            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE most reuerend Cardinal of Lorraine, friendly reader, did in his life time long feede vs with a vaine hope of a view of the Legend of the life of his brother the Duke of Guiſe, who was ſlaine before Orleans, the which we haue with great deuotion diligently waited for, in ful aſſurance that among ſo manie learned men, as the ſaid Cardinal had alwaies at commandement, he would chuſe out one of the quickeſt wit and capacitie, who might frame ſome worke worthie the ſight of our France, which long time hath ſeene fewe deuiſes pleaſant vnto the eye, or delectable in the eare: We knowe alſo that the Cardinal was not deſtitute of ſufficient ſtore of remem<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>brances, requiſite for the beautifying of ſuch a labour. But after much attendance, we finally haue found our ſelues frustrate of our expectation, through the deceaſſe of the ſaid Cardinal, who hath left vnto vs the making of the Legendarie as wel of his owne perſon, as alſo of the aforeſaid Duke of Guiſe, and the rest of the brethren: whereby diuers haue bene occaſioned to thinke euil of this his ſaid promiſe, and to ſuppoſe that himſelf was fully reſolued to feede them in hope, through doubt least his flower potte ſhould haue bene diſcouered, the filthines and abhomination whereof, would haue yelded him and al his progenie, most ſtincking and abominable in the ſight of our whole nation. Not wasting anie longer time therefore in the diſputation, or arguing vpon the cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes which haue moued him thus to cast dust in our eyes, neither making anie accompt of his lies and gloſings, it is requiſite that my ſelfe ſhould yelde a reckoning of mine owne doings, and diſplay the cauſes which haue moued me to vndertake to eaſe the ſaide Cardinals heyres (if ſo be he hath anie, for my ſelfe neither am, neither wil be counted in their number) of ſuch their labours, as they ſhould haue ſusteined by writing this Legende, compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hending the liues not onely of the Duke of Guiſe, and of the Cardinal of Lorraine, but alſo of al the rest of the brethren,
<pb facs="tcp:16276:3"/>
which neuertheleſſe are not diſplayed at ful, but only in part.</p>
            <p>Some yeres therefore are paſſed; ſince that thinking vpon the miſerable calamities of our France, which I did ſee daily to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe, not that I was ſo blinde, as not to beholde how God being prouoked through the iniquities of the French Nation, did ſtretch forth his arme against them, yet marking with what ſtones and weapons he endeuored to humble vs and aſſwage our pride, I found that the houſe of Guiſe, among others were as his chiefeſt inſtruments, whoſe crafts and cruelties exerciſed ouer both great and ſmal, and therefore alreadie publiſhed in ſundrie pamphlets, ought not ſtill to lie ſcattered abroade, in hazard of periſhing in the pit of ſilence, or by being neuer detected vnto the poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie. This was therefore one of the cauſes, that moued me by litle and litle to begin to ſerche among my writings and papers, for ſome bookes and remembrances correſpondent vnto ſuch as the Cardinal in his life time made ſo great accompt of, as to lay them for the most part vpon his table, and then to ſay, (as he did in the time of Francis the ſecond, at an aſsemblie of the chiefest estates of the realme at Fontainebleau) that the ſame were the crownes of his life which ſhould yelde him immortal: Out of the which I began to collect certaine places and notable matters, hopinge thereby ſomewhat to aſſiſte a certaine friende of mine, who began happily with this piece of worke: But when he gaue wholy ouer this labour to the intent the better to tend vnto things of greater importance, which one day I hope ſhal come to light, alſo that the murders of S. Bartlemew ſo bloodily celebrated had euen lighted in the necke of their other driftes (for therein the ſaid Lords of Guiſe were in maner chiefe doers) I thought it not amiſſe to ſet forth before ſuch as are thereof ignorant, part of their life and maners, ſeing that them ſelues do delite in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuation of the ſame, and that the wicked man must both heare and ſee things which he would not, becauſe himſelfe committeth ſuch as he ought not.</p>
            <p>Now am I ſo farre of, through theſe remembrances collected here and there, (as anie who haue read or peruſed ſuch diſcourſes as within theſe fiftene yeres haue bene publiſhed, may at the firſt bluſh perceiue) from restraining the deſires and pennes of ſuch as
<pb facs="tcp:16276:3"/>
haue in their hands other more large, ample, or exact Legends of the race of the Guiſians, that contrariwiſe I do moſt heartily de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire them no longer to defraude our France the common mother of vs al, of ſuch remembrances and warnings as ought often to be ſet before her eyes, the which the houſe of Guiſe both haue, and yet do endeuour to plucke out of her head, whereby them ſelues may afterward conduct and order al thinges after their owne pleaſures and ambitious appetites.</p>
            <p>Manie times haue I wondered at the dulneſſe of diuers French men who otherwiſe do profeſſe but ouer much knowledge and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, and yet in the meane time do ſeeke to perſuade vs that whatſoeuer commoditie we haue, doeth proceede onely of theſe men, from whome in deede most of our inconueniences do ariſe: For had not priuate affection bleared the eyes of their vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, I dare ſay they would be of an other minde, and that whenſoeuer it ſhal pleaſe God to take out of their ſight the looking glaſſe of ambition, reuenge, and ſuch other pretences as doe dazel their ſight, themſelues wil willingly eſchewe and detest that filthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes which now they do cheriſh and worſhip.</p>
            <p>In reſpect of thoſe who daily with me do behold theſe euils, them do I wiſh to conſider how or in what maner they may be able to procure anie remedie thereunto, and to the ſame earneſtly to ſet their hands, as the lawe of Nature bindeth them.</p>
            <p>As for ſuch matters as herein my ſelf haue entreated vpon, at the firſt I ſuppoſed I might haue reduced into ten or twelue leaues of paper al that I minded thereof to publiſh: but being once ſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped I was ſodainely caried away into ſo marueilous a ſea of affaires, that before that I can recouer any hauen, I ſhalbe conſtrained through innumerable rockes and perilous goulfes, to make a long and tedious nauigation: And as thoſe who hauing once forſaken land, can hardely in a great while recouer the ſame, although both with oares and ſayles they doe what ſo lyeth in them, euen ſo I being entred ſo farre into this Guiſian ſea, must &amp; wil now endeuour my ſelfe to come to as ſpeedy a hauen as poſſibly I may, and yet after ſuch maner as I hope your ſelues, though that I take not land ſo ſoone as you would wiſh, wil neuertheles hold me excuſed: For the tractes &amp; trauerſes are ſo long and diuers, with ſo many waues one
<pb facs="tcp:16276:4"/>
in an others necke, &amp; ſuch contrariety of winds puffing and toſſing the courſe of my litle barke diuers wayes, that many times I am ready to beginne againe, and doe ſtil finde new occaſions of further trauaile: howbeit with Gods helpe I will recouer land with all poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible ſpeede, ſetting before your eyes the rest of this Legende.</p>
            <p>The ſtyle is ſuch as you ſee, namely ſimple and naked after the maner of remembrances and collections. For, for the moſt part I am content to vſe onely the tearmes and phraſes of ſuch other writers as before me haue delte herin: and notwithstanding that I haue ſet forth most of them at large, yet haue I not done it to the ende to fill vp paper, but onely in reſpect that in my opinion it ſeemed neceſſary for the explaning of ſuch pointes as in that place were to be handled. For I doubt not but that the time may come when we ſhall ſee a full historie, wherein theſe homely and ſimple beginnings or deſcriptions of the deedes of the houſe of Guiſe ſhalbe ſet forth in ſuch tearmes as the matter requireth: and vnto me it is enough if my rude and ſillie diſcourſe may ſerue ſome of our french men as a light wherwith to behold and feele the fier which hath already conſumed many, and yet doth ouermuch ſmoke ſtill in purpoſe to wast the remnant, vnleſſe a mightier then man doe take in hand to prouide a remedie.</p>
            <p>It might be demaunded wherefore I haue ſo long deferred the bringing of this into light: but I may anſwere that it is yet time enough, alſo that it were to be wiſhed that this Legend might be an ample diſcourſe of all miſchiefes fully ended and past, whereby we ſhould be exempt of all cauſe of feare in time to come. But the ſpirit of the Cardinal of Lorraine liueth stil in France, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing deſisting from all meanes to bring the estate into like ſtaye as in his life time he pretended, which in caſe many cannot com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend or perceiue, I woulde be very glad if alſo in time they might not feele it vnto their owne confuſions. For my part I can not poſſibly betraye her of whom I do holde my life, and therefore do beginne to warne her of ſuch fraudulent embuſhments as are layed to deuoure her, vnder pretence of her maintenance, wherin I would that my brethren and fellowe countreymen ſhoulde, (if they lust) reape the commoditie of my good will toward them, the which I minde more plainely to ſet before their eyes, if God lend
<pb facs="tcp:16276:4"/>
me life, not permitting any other to be more affectionate to reſist by lawfull meanes the driftes and practiſes of foreyne tyrantes, then my ſelfe. And notwithstanding I haue not ſo good opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie ſo to do as many others, yet will I ſo effectually endeuour it, that the tokens of my good will ſhal not be to ſeeke. I could haue wiſhed that I had ſome other matter to deale in, nothing doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting but that all men do knowe that I were able to write of other affaires, which indede is true: but I trust they can not denie but that it is both time and labour well beſtowed, when a man diſclo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth vnto the posterity, yea and to ſuch as yet do liue, ſuch things as are most neceſſarye for their instruction.</p>
            <p>Moreouer in deducting of theſe matters, I haue not preſcribed vnto any the end wherunto he ought to applie them, neither what commoditie he may reape by the knowledge therof, ſeing that it wilbe eaſie for euery one to comprehend the ſame, conſidering alſo that both the thinges which be paſſed, and thoſe which are contei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in this booke, together with ſuch as ſhalbe diſcloſed in others that ſhall followe, are ſo cleere and euident vnto al men, that I ſhould euen do open wrong to their memorie and iudgement, if I ſhould make any long diſcourſe therupon. My onely request ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is, that it would pleaſe all Frenchmen to call to minde their auncient generoſity and liberty, &amp; to withstand al ſlauiſh bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage, whereinto through the factions of the Guiſians they haue bene drawen, who abuſing the ſimplicitie of our Kings, haue redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced the whole eſtate of our realme into ſuch danger as al men may euidently perceiue.</p>
            <p>I am no otherwiſe perſwaded, but that diuers courtiers and ſeruants of the houſe of Guiſe in reading in this legendary ſuch thinges as are written in their owne conſciences, will ſhake their heads and bend their browes againſt me, contrarying this thing or that thing, whom I am to requeſt patiently to beare with me, vntil they ſee the rest of the bookes which ſhall ſhortly followe this, if God permit: For then peraduenture they will powre water into their wine. Otherwiſe if they be deſirous to publiſh any other Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gendes in their masters behalfe, ſo that it be with better conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences then them ſelues haue ſerued the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, I am therewithal very wel content. But in caſe they ſeeke to wrong the trueth, let them be aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured
<pb facs="tcp:16276:5"/>
that their flatteries and falſhodes ſhalbe reueiled to all the world, to the end men may beware of them, and that in time to come none may vnwittingly be deceiued.</p>
            <p>The Cardinal had continually one principle in his mouth touching the aduancement of his enterpriſes, which was, that a lie faced out three hours, or as many daies at the least, was much worth, practiſing therein the ſaying of an ancient philoſopher, which was, that a lyer ought to be vtterly deuoide of ſhame: which rule his ſeruants and partakers doe ſtil obſerue, thinking that in ſtoutly denying the thing which is more manifest then euen day light, the time will weare away and for that moſt of them do litle or nothing at all regarde anie religion, it is not to be mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueiled, though they treade vnder their feete al equitie and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestie, which are the two pillers and ſtayes of mans life, ſo that long to contend with them were but loſt labour: wherfore we are to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre them vnto the iudgement ſeate of almighty God, before whom they ſhal at length appeare, notwithstanding they endeuour to perſwade both them ſelues and other men of the contrary.</p>
            <p>If anie man aske me wherefore I do now publiſh but one booke of this legend, ſeeing that I haue promiſed more in the title, I doe in dede confeſſe that I am in poſſeſſion of the remembrances of the whole worke, but being ſurpriſed, and as it were manieled with an ineuitable let, and the printer alſo being importunate to publiſh ſo much as I had already done, hath wrested out of my hands this first part, wherein finding any faultes eſcaped through the ſaid printers negligence, I trust you will neuertheleſſe excuſe me, as wanting opportunitie to remaine at his preſſe, and leyſure to write ouer againe that which I had but ſcribled before, hoping that the next bookes ſhall be better corrected, alſo that if in any part of this booke you miſſe any particular matter, you ſhal finde the ſame in ſome other more conuenient place hereafter. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit if ſo be that ſuch of the race of Guiſe as do remaine, might ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teine ſo much fauour of God as that it would pleaſe him to turne their hearts, ſo that they would ſuffer our realme to be in quiet, and that contenting them ſelues with that which is paſt, and ſo through courteous and faithful behauiours would blot out the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of their former miſchiefes, I would be glad to breake

promiſe, and would endeuour to be the first that ſhould cast the remembrance thereof into the pit of obliuion: but in continuing the race which hitherto they haue runne, they ſhal find both braines &amp; hands enough to reſiſt the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. And although that through crafts and treaſon they and their ſemblables haue hitherto, rather then by force of armes ſo highly adua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ced them ſelues, yet wil the trueth in the end ouercome and haue his courſe, ſo that they ſhal get nothing by following the ſteppes of their aunceſters, ſaue onely they ſhal become ſo much the more odious both vnto God &amp; men. Yea they ſhal builde their pinacle ſo high that finally it ſhal fall vpon their owne heads, and enſnare them ſelues. If therefore they wil preuent this danger, and aſſubiect them ſelues vnto their due<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, it is the thing whereof I ſhould be verie glad: neither can I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie but that the houſe of Guiſe conteining them ſelues within their limites, might haue done good ſeruice to the crowne of France: but of ſeruants ſeeking to become maſters they haue mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red all, and ouerthrowne both themſelues and others. Thus loth to be in this matter ouer tedious, I beſeech you friendly readers, to ſhew a good countenance vnto this firſt booke, vntill the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming forth of the rest which ſhortly ſhalbe preſented vnto your view: This do I aſſuredly truſt that you wil do, in caſe you be natural French men, that is to ſay, affectionate vnto the ſeruice of God, the commoditie of your countrie, and the conſeruation of your auncient and noble libertie.</p>

The ſonnes named Charles, Robert and Federic dyed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out iſſue: But of the daughters, the eldeſt named Marie was maryed vnto Enguerand Earle of Coucy, who alſo died without heyres: The ſeconde called Katherine was giuen to Iames Marquiſe of Baden, with the dowrye of three pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoſtſhipps, namely S. Dier, Arches, and Bruettes, beſides a good ſumme of money, in conſideration whereof, the ſaid Marquiſe renounced his whole title vnto the ſucceſſion in the Duchye of Lorraine: The third daughter Iſabell was maried vnto Rene of Anjou the ſonne of Lewes of Anjou, the ſeconde ſonne to Iohn King of France. This Rene the firſt ſucceeded his father in lawe Charles in the Duchye of Lorraine, ſeeking alſo the poſſeſſion of the Duchye of Bar, in the right of his mother Yoland of Arragon: wherein Anthony Earle of Vaudemont, ſonne of Ferry Duke Charles brother withſtood him, and chalenged the ſayd Duchye, whereunto he was aſſiſted by Philippe Duke of Burgundye, who was offended with the mariage of the ſaid Rene of Anjou vnto Iſabell of Lorraine. Hereupon in a conflicte neere vnto Bulainuille, the ſaid Rene was taken
<pb facs="tcp:16276:7"/>
priſoner, and thence conueyed vnto Dijon vnder the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtodie of the Duke of Burgundye aforeſaid, where he was deteined fifteene yeres at the petition of the Engliſhmen and Burgundions, vnder whom at the ſame time Ferry of Vaudemont, ſonne to this Earle Anthony, did ſerue: how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit finally it was agreed that Duke Rene the priſoner ſhould giue his eldeſt daughter Yoland in mariage vnto this Ferry of Vaudemont, with the ſumme of two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred thouſande crownes in the name of a ranſome. In the meane time Lewes of Anjou Duke Rene his eldeſt bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, intending the conqueſt of Naples, whereof Pope Clemente had crowned him Kinge, dyed without iſſue, whereof ſo ſoone as Duke Rene was aduertiſed, he purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the poſſeſſion of the ſame Realme, but notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the ayde of moſt ſtates of Italie, as Genes, Milan and other Potentates, he was by the Spanierdes finally ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled Naples, and forced to retire into France vnto his brother in lawe King Charles the ſeuenth, whereas after ſome warre againſt the citie of Metz, hauing knowledge of the death of his wife Iſabell, he reſigned the whole gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nement of Lorraine vnto his eldeſt ſonne Iohn, in full in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tente to liue the reſte of his time quietly and peaceably within his dominions of Prouence and Anjou.</p>
            <p>Iohn ſurnamed of Calabre, after he had gouerned Lor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raine eighteene yeres dyed, leauing a ſonne named Iohn of Anjou, who in the time of his grandfather Rene afore<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſaid, fianced Anne the daughter of King Lewes the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenth, albeit afterwarde breaking of with his ſaid father in law through the perſuaſions of the Duke of Burgundye, and entending by repudiating the daughter of France, to conclude a mariage with Marie the ſaid Duke of Burgun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyes daughter, being euen at the very point ſo to doe, he dyed. By meanes whereof Rene the ſeconde of that name, ſonne of Ferrye of Vaudemont brother vnto Duke Rene of Anjou, and of Yoland ſiſter vnto Duke Iohn, ſucceeded in the ſaid Duchyes of Lorraine and Bar in the yere 1473. for want of other heyres, during the life of his grandfather on

the mothers ſide Rene of Anjou, &amp; of his mother Yoland, whome the inhabitantes of the countrie would not accept for gouernour. This Duke waged continuall warre againſt the Duke of Burgundye, whome finally he ouerthrewe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Nancy, in whoſe time liued his great grandfather Rene of Anjou, termed King of Sicill, who reſted his old bones within his Duchyes of Prouence and Anjou: him did Kinge Lewes the eleuenth, greatly cheriſh and quietly entertaine, fearing his aſſociation with the Duke of Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gundye and the Engliſh men, who greatly thereunto ſolli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited him. This King Rene ſent worde to his nephew Rene, that in caſe he intended to be his heyre, he ſhould wholy take vpon him the full armes of Anjou, which proffer he refuſed, well was he content to quarter togither the armes of Anjou, Sicill, Prouence, and Lorraine. howbeit vpon his other refuſall, his grandfather King Rene inſtituted Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les Earle of Maine his nephew by his brother Charles alſo Earle of Maine, for his inheritor, whereof Rene being cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifyed, he haſted toward his grandfather, but all being done and paſt he returned backe againe in a great heat, and King Rene died in the yere 1482. Shortly after alſo dyed Charles of Maine his competitor, whereby Lewes the eleuenth King of France, remained lord of the countries of Prouence, Anjou, and Maine, by the gifte of the laſt will of the ſaid Charles, who alſo left vnto him the Duchye of Bar.</p>
            <p>After the death of King Lewes the eleuenth, Rene of Lorraine, who through the perſuaſion of Pope Sixtus was gone into Italie to ſeeke the conqueſt of the realmes of Naples and Sicill, and there had continued in wages with the Venitians a certayn ſpace, did now returne into France, there to chalenge his right in the Countyes of Prouence &amp; Anjou, with the Dutchye of Bar. This Dutchy was graun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted vnto him, conditionally that he and his ſucceſſours ſhould for the ſame doe ho<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mage vnto the King of France, who thereby remained ſoueraine lord ouer the ſame but as for the Countyes of Prouence and Anjou, it was anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, that they being parcel of the demaynes of the crowne,
<pb facs="tcp:16276:8"/>
might not fall vnto the diſtaffe: ſo that finally by conſente of King Charles the eight and this Duke Rene, the contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſie was referred vnto the arbitrement of three vmpiers, whiles in the meane time the King committed vnto the Duke a regiment of an hundred men of armes, with the enterteinment of ſixe and thirtie thouſand frankes of yerly penſion. Now in the yere of our Lord 1489, the Neopoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tanes deteſting the tyranny of yong Alphonſus, required the ayde of this Duke Rene, who thereunto prepared him ſelfe: but duringe his preparation, the three vmpiers afore<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſaid pronounced their arreſte, wherein it was found tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

This man had by his ſecond wife named Philippe, the ſiſter vnto the Duke of Guelderland, twelue children, of whom ſeuen dyed in their youth, whereby he left only fiue, who all were ſonnes, na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med Anthony, Claude, Iohn, Lewes and Francis.</p>
            <p>Anthony ſucceeded his father in the Duchyes of Lor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raine and Bar, alſo in the Countye of Vaudemont and Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſat of Ponte: and by the death of this Charles Duke of Guelderlande his mothers brother, in the ſaid Duchye of Guelderlande, and in the Countye of Zutphan, leauing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind him three children: Francis who ſucceeded in his do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions,

Anne maried vnto the prince of Orange, and Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>colas, firſt biſhop of Verdun, and afterwarde of Metz, and finally (as preſently he is) earle of Vaudemont, and at this preſent father in law vnto Henrye the third King of Fra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce.</p>
            <p>Francis the ſucceſſour of his father Anthony, had by Chriſtian the daughter vnto the King of Denmarck, iſſue, one ſonne named Charles, and two daughters.</p>
            <p>Charles the ſeconde, and ſonne vnto Francis, ſuccee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded his father in the yere 1545. and preſently liueth, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing to wife Claude the daughter of King Henrye the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond by whom he hath diuers children now liuing.</p>
            <p>Claude, the ſecond ſonne of Rene Duke of Guiſe and Baron of Ginuille, repayred vnto the French courte, where in ſhort ſpace he obteined the gouernement of Champa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gne and Burgundye, and marying Anthoynet of Bourbon aunt vnto the late King of Nauarre he had by her, iſſue ſix ſonnes, namely Francis, Charles, Claude, Lewes, Rene, and the great Prior of France: of whom, but eſpecially of Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis, who after his father was Duke of Guiſe, and finally ſlayne by Poltrot at the ſiege of Orleans, and of Charles afterward Cardinall of Lorraine, we wil hereafter ſpeake more largelye, not omitting what ſo may be incident tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the other brethren, of whom Claude obteined the Dutchye of Aumale, and was ſlaine at the ſiege of Rochel, Rene enioyed the Marquiſat of Allebeufe, Lewes was crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Cardinall of Guiſe, and the yongeſt was made great Prior of France.</p>
            <p>Iohn the thirde ſonne of Rene, and biſhop of Metz, was through great ſute vnto Leo the tenth electe Cardinall in the yere 1518, and afterward being ordinarily reſident in the French courte, obteyned great fauour with King Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis the firſt, for he neuer medled with matters of eſtate, but paſſed ouer his time in pleaſure.</p>
            <p>The other two ſonnes, namely Lewes and Francis dyed in the warres, the one in the realme of Naples, and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther at the battayle of Pauie.</p>
            <p>Duke Anthony the firſt ſonne, was of a reaſonable good
<pb facs="tcp:16276:9"/>
diſpoſition, and voluntarily came vnto Dijon vnto King Francis, and there did him hommage for the Duchye of Bar, ſhewing him ſelfe very ſorye for his offence which he had committed in ſeeking to defraude the ſame King Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis of the Duchye of Guelderlande, which he pretended to fall to him by ſucceſſion in the right of his mother. For he had practiſed by one Iames Canis the Borowmaſter of Nemegue, to rayſe the commons, and keepe the ſaid King out of his poſſeſſion: but then ſeing that the people would not accept him, but had ſubmitted them ſelues vnto the Duke of Cleuelande, he fought all meanes poſſible to be reconciled, &amp; to cure this skarre, which through the helpe and fauour of his brother Iohn, Cardinal of Lorraine, he ſoone brought to paſſe, and King Francis did cleerly par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, and forgiue him.</p>
            <p>This Cardinal Iohn was the iollyeſt encrocher of bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices aliue, as might plainly be perceiued by the eſtate wher into he brought the whole French Church: but becauſe he otherwiſe was of a reaſonable courteous diſpoſition, a great ſpender, and therewithall very liberall, all was taken in meetly good parte.</p>
            <p>The third brother who was Duke of Guiſe, and father vnto this Duke of Guiſe and Cardinal of Lorraine with the reſt, was neuer put in any great credite, neither had the charge of any waightie affayres committed vnto him. For his leading of the Kinges power without his loue or leaue into Lorraine to the ſuccour of his brother Duke Anthony, who, as the talke went, was ſore ouerlayed with Anabaptiſtes, was taken in very euil parte, and him ſelfe (had not the Conſtable at that time great maſter and Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhal of France entreated for him) would King Francis haue committed vnto priſon and hardely dealt withal: For King Francis was ſuch an one as would not permit thoſe who without his owne liberalitie were of them ſelues of no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation, ſo farre to encroche vpon his auctoritie, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared at another time, when the ſaid Lord of Guiſe being gouernour of Burgundye, ſought to enter into the caſtle of
<pb facs="tcp:16276:9"/>
Auſſonne, which at that time was a ſeueral charge, and in the cuſtodie of a french gentleman of the retinewe of the Marquiſe of Rotelin, named the Lord of Rouueray, who withſtoode him &amp; forbade him the entrie therinto, which the ſaid de Rouueray durſt not haue done, in caſe the ſaid Lord of Guiſe had bene a prince, who for that cauſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained vnto King Francis, but he for that deede greatly commended the ſayd gentleman, and laughed to ſcorne him, who vndertooke the perſon of a prince of his blood. This Duke pinched to the quicke, and did extremely per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecute diuers marchantes of the beſt townes of France, but finally beginning with the marchants of Paris, who hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to were not accuſtomed vnto the raſor, the whole citie tooke vpon them the matter, and cauſed his commiſſions to be reuoked, impriſoning ſome of his promoters, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at the reſt vaniſhed away like ſnow againſt the ſunne: for which cauſe he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ceiued ſo grieuous an hatred againſt the inhabitants therof, that neither for dearth or plenty, what abundance of corne, wine, or other victuals ſo euer there were within the cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trey of Champagne or Bourgundy, du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring his gouernement of either of them, the ſaid citie of Paris could euer come by any, either for money or loue without plentie of letters of marte, which were ſweetely payed for and deerely bought. howbeit by that meanes he neuer after durſt deale with any whole eſtate or commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalty, not that he therefore quite quayled, but ſtill hauked after confiſcations here and there, and ſo lightely mette with one or other: wherefore his whole rigourous force he executed ouer the inhabitants of his owne iuriſdiction, whom he euen flaied with al extremitie, which was the cauſe, that King Henry through his fathers aduice, would neuer after commit vnto him any matter of weight, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though his two eldeſt ſonnes the Duke of Guiſe and the Cardinal of Lorraine did beare great ſway, for he was at that ſtaye, that co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ducting his children vnto the court gate, he there left them, and ſo returned backe againe, whereof I doubt whether the father or children ought moſt to haue
<pb facs="tcp:16276:10"/>
bene aſhamed: Finally this man dyed through poyſon, and as became a good Chriſtian, pardoned thoſe perſons who miſtaking him for an other, had haſtened the courſe of his dayes.</p>

For although in France were no want of men farre more meet to vndertake ſuch a charge, and execute that function, yet did the credit of his vncle Iohn procure this fauour at the handes of the great King Francis, together w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſome tokens of his quick wit and capacitie herein, al which notwithſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding, during y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> reigne of the ſaid great King Francis, they were not of any eſtima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: For this Charles was ſimplie named lord of Reims, &amp; his brother Fra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cis, Earle of Aumale, their father being yet liuing, &amp; the reſt of the brethre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> were forced to preferre &amp; thruſt the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſelues forward with might &amp; maine. Again, King Francis was not ignorant that theſe men might ſtirre vp coales and procure ſome broiles, vnder pretence of the counties of Prouence and Anjou, and ſo trouble the ſtate, vpon which cauſes he credited them no further then nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des he muſt. In deede he ſo highly honoured the beautie of their eldeſt ſiſter, as that he permitted her at the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie of Queene Eleanor to be attired, in Princeſſe araye, although afterward perceiuing theſe ſtrangers to preuaile as if they had alreadie bene Princes of France, he denied the wife of the Marquiſe of Maine of the mantel royal. It is not alſo vnknowen how the ſame King, toward his end made but ſmal accompt of the Conſtable, who therefore withdrew him ſelf vnto his owne houſe, the chiefe occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of which diſpleaſure aroſe of that, that through the commendation of the ſaid Conſtable, his ſonne the Dau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phine Henry had reteined into his fauour the ſaid Lords of Guiſe, the conſequence whereof he doubted. Their allia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce alſo vnto the daughter of the great Seneſchal of Norman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die,
<pb facs="tcp:16276:10"/>
whom al that time the ſaid Dauphin kept, cauſed that the ſame King Francis who before had highly fauoured her, did now alſo diſdaine and miſlike her. This Ladie who was called the great Seneſchal, was daughter vnto the late lord of S. Valliers, and with her owne maydenhead redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med her fathers life, but afterward to the great reproche and ſlander of our France, after ſhe was halfe ſpent, was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to the Dauphine Henrie, whoſe hearte ſhe ſo ſtedfaſtly wonne, as that finally ſhe was created Ducheſſe of Valen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinois, and in effect became Queene of France. Wherupon the houſe of Guiſe accompting her as a conuenient bridge, by the which they might paſſe ouer into France, did think it meete to take holde of ſo good an occaſion, although it were in effect but an homelie ſhift, and therefore procured the marriage of their thirde brother, afterward Duke of Aumale, vnto the yongeſt daughter of this ſaid Seneſchal, by whoſe meanes, they the further inſinuated them ſelues into King Henries fauour, vpon whom in the meane time they practiſed two ſeueral drifts, wherein we may as in a glaſſe behold the reſt of their behauiours toward the eſtate of France.</p>
            <p>Firſt by meanes of this Seneſchal they preſumed ſo farre, as to attempt to wreſt from the Dauphine Henrie a promiſe of reſtauration vnto the counties of Prouence and Anjou, as part of a dowrie toward this their brothers marriage: Howbeit as God doeth for the moſt part, euen by the ſimpleſt perſons abate the pride and crueltie of the mightieſt, ſo likewiſe did he now cauſe the onely counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of the Lord de la Cheſnay to force the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> moſt ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, and euen as it were in deſpite of their hearts, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaſe this grant, being in this only reſpect to be accomp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted happie, that through the throwing of the ſame into the fire, they did alſo therewithal conſume and reduce into aſhes the aſſured proofe and manifeſt detection of their trayterous fellonie, conſidering that in caſe King Francis had but once had anie inckling of the ſame, it would haue bene the vtter extirpation and vndoing not
<pb facs="tcp:16276:11"/>
onlie of them ſelues, but of the great Seneſchal alſo.</p>
            <p>Let vs now therefore proceede vnto the ſecond point which was this. On the one ſide King Francis not long before his deceaſſe was much accompanied with two per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of whome he made great accompt: The one was the Cardinal of Tournon chanceler of the order, and Maſter of his chappel: The other was the Lord Annebaut Marſhal and Admiral of France, and beſides both theſe there was the Conſtable alſo, who notwithſtanding he came not to the court, yet did he reteine the office of great Maſter of France. On the other ſide the Dauphine was entangled with the Ladie great Seneſchal, vpon whom two of the brethren of Guiſe did continually attend, namely Francis Earle of Aumale, and Charles Lord of Reims becauſe of the alliance aforeſaid, al which notwithſtanding, yet was he moſt addicted vnto the Lord of S. Andrews, whoſe fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther had bene his gouernour. Now then ſeing that the ſicknes, whereof the late King Francis the firſt died, was long and in moſt of the phiſitions opinions in maner incu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, the Lords of Guiſe perſuaded the aforeſaid Dau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phine that ſo ſone as he had gotten poſſeſſion of the crowne, he ſhould ſet forth an edict, the contents whereof were, that no man ſhould from thence forth retaine in his hands two offices, by meanes of the which they promiſed vnto them ſelues the ſpoyle of the noble men aforeſaide, beſides that vnder colour therof they might haue free ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe vnto the handling of the whole eſtate, and ſo in time atteine vnto their aſpiring drifts &amp; purpoſes, and that the rather, becauſe they perceiued none of the Princes of the blood ouer haſtie to intrude them ſelues thereinto.</p>
            <p>Howbeit now before we go any further, we haue to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der two other notable cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces which happened preſently at the death of King Francis afore named.<note place="margin">

               </note> wherein beſides their manifeſt iniurie offered vnto their owne perſons, in this reſpecte, they haue alſo ſhewed them ſelues verye vnthankful toward the ſaid Conſtable: For it is not vnknowen vnto all thoſe, who duringe the reigne of the great King Francis had anie dealings in matters of eſtate, that as wel the father as alſo the vncles of the ſaid Lords of Guiſe, had neuer any more aſſured or faithful friend in France then the ſaid Conſtable, who long before their comming into that country was alreadie in great creditte and eſtimation with his Prince, and afterward with incredible fauour did ſucceede two great maſters of France, the one the Lord of Boiſy his couſin germaine, the other the Duke of Sauoy his Father in Law, and final<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly atteined vnto the hieſt degree next vnder the Princes of the kings blood, that euer any man (of what eſtate, cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, or condicion ſo euer he were) might clime vnto in France. To him onely aboue al other (I ſay) is the whole generation of Guiſe bound &amp; beholding for their deſcent from a Princeſſe of France and daughter of Vendoſme, becauſe that he the ſaid conſtable was the motioner of the
<pb facs="tcp:16276:13"/>
marriage betwene their father and mother, who alreadie nothing hoping or once thinking vpon anie ſo good hap, had begonne to caſt his eye toward another Ladie of farre meaner eſtate and calling. Againe, the onely requeſt and peticion of the Conſtable were of ſufficient force in their behalfe, at the returne of King Francis out of Spaine to keepe free their father out of priſon, for his leading of the Kings power and forces into Lorraine without the ſaid Kings loue or leaue, yea, and to reſtore him againe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to fauour. Again, after the deceaſſe of the Kings daughter, who was Queene of Scots, and that the King of Scots was deſirous to take another wife in France, the Conſtable was the only preferrer of the ſaid Lords of Guiſes ſiſter, the late Queene, mother vnto Marie Stuard how Queene, who by his meanes was preferred before many other both more marriageable and meete for ſuch a man then her ſelfe. Howbeit I can not denie but that it was neceſſarie to ſend her into places vnknowen, for that whiles ſhe remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned at Nancy ſhe endeuoured to haue forſaken the court of Lorraine, and haue yelded her perſon vnto the Abbot of Beaulieu great vncle vnto the late Duke of Bouillon, yea had not the Counteſſe of Lignanges warned the Lady Rene of Bourbon of her determination, ſhe had aſſured<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly departed with the ſaid Abbot into his cloyſter of Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieu. For the which practiſe the afore named Abbot was rewarded with the natural courteſies of this race: for after that vpon their fidelities he had yelded him ſelf into their clawes, and that it ſeemed they had forgotten the wanton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of their ſaid ſiſter, they procured his murder at vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wares, accompanying their cruelty both with periurie and great ingratitude: For notwithſtanding the houſe of Sedan hath alwaies ſtood the race of Lorraine in great ſteade, yet haue the Lords of Guiſe in diuers wiſe ſince perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the ſame.</p>
            <p>Now therefore to returne vnto their ingratitude to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde the Conſtable. King Henrie the ſecond comming vnto the crowne in the yere 1546, and hauing, as is afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid,
<pb facs="tcp:16276:13"/>
committed the whole regiment therof vnto his good goſſippe the Conſtable, did ſhortly after take the Earle of Aumale, his brother the Lord of Reims, and the Lords of Sedan and of S. Andrewes, and preſent them vnto the ſaid Conſtable with theſe wordes. Goſſippe, theſe ſchol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers do I giue vnto you, to the end they may learne of you, and obey you as my ſelfe: I pray you traine them vp in my affaires, ſo that vnder you during your life they may do me ſeruice. And then turning vnto them he ſaid, I do giue you this man for your father and Scholemaſter: him loue and honour, doing whatſoeuer he ſhal command, for my ſelfe do accompt him my father, and the moſt deare friend and faithful ſeruant which euer my father had, or my ſelfe may haue.</p>
            <p>Afterward the ſaid Lords of Guiſes father at his next meeting with the Conſtable ſaid vnto his ſonnes. Behold your father, for my ſelfe hath he alſo created: him honour and ſerue, for we al be bound ſo to do.</p>
            <p>The teſtimonie alſo of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> late Cardinal their vncle, which he gaue in the preſence of the Cardinal of Lenoncourt deſcribeth more plainely their dueties vnto the Conſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, for it was pronounced in his abſence, and they practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing ſome conſpiracie againſt him.

To begin therfore at the foundation of al theſe euils, which ſince haue almoſt ſubuerted the whole eſtate of France: we are to vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d that the Conſtable ſeeking the preferme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of his nephues, did about eightene yeres ſince procure vnto the eldeſt brother of the houſe of Chaſtillon the degree of a Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal, which in that time through ignorance and ſuperſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious zeale was greatly deſired among al eſtates, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward did by al conuenient meanes aduance as it were ſteppe by ſteppe the other two brethren Iaſper and Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis, into al commiſſions and offices of warfare both by ſea and land, by meanes whereof they hauing obteined great credite among the whole nobilitie, it was an eaſie matter for the Admiral then but Lord of Chaſtillon, as wel through the ſupport of his ſaid vncle the Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſtable, as alſo in reſpect of the debates and quarels that then were pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuted betwene the Lords of Dampierre &amp; S. Andrewes, to inſinuate him ſelfe into the eſpecial fauour of King Henrie then Dauphine. This the Earle of Aumale percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing, who in thoſe daies was in leaſt reputation with King Francis, he thought it meete for the atteining of the ſaid Dauphines good wil, to ioyne in familiaritie and ſtraight league with the ſaid Lord of Chaſtillon, which familiaritie eche of them ſo firmely obſerued for the ſpace of foure or fiue yeres, that theſe two Lords could not liue one without an other, but as a token of their more mutual agreeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, did for the moſt part apparel them ſelues daily in like ſutes of raime<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t. In the meane time it ſo fel out y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the father of theſe Lords of Guiſe, purpoſing the preferment of his familie by

al meanes poſſible, ſought to ioyne his third ſonne the Marquiſe of Maine in marriage vnto the yongeſt daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the great Seneſchal, the mother being as then the Dauphines harlot. Of this marriage the Earle of Aumale could in no wiſe like, and for that cauſe fearing to prouoke the Dauphine againſt him ſelfe he brake the matter vnto his companion the Lord of Chaſtillon, deſiring him, as his eſpecial friend, to giue him ſome good counſaile how he might herein behaue him ſelfe, affirming, and that euen with teares, that whatſoeuer might happen, he could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer giue his conſent thereunto. The Lord of Chaſtillon ſeeking to comfort him, endeuoured to appeaſe him, and after diuers debating of the matter betwene them, their reſolute determination was, <hi>that better were an inche of au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie with honour, then a whole fathome with ſhame.</hi> Howbeit after this reſolution, the Earle of Aumale did ſo farre ſtray from following the aduice wherein before he had ſo ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinately perſiſted, that now to the end to diſplace the ſaid Lord of Chaſtillo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> out of al fauour with the Dauphine, he ſhewed the Marſhal of Vieille ville their co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon frie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, how that he could hardly haue beleued that the Lord of Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtillon had ſo enuied his honour and aduancement, as thus to haue encouraged him to withſtand the aforeſaid mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage. This therfore was one occaſion of their diſpleaſure, of the reſt we wil ſpeake more in place conuenient.</p>
            <p>Through this mariage one of the brethren is now pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uided for,<note place="margin">The practi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſes of the Duke of Guiſe for getting of a wife.</note> let vs therefore procede to the preferment of the reſt. Duke Rene their gra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dfather maried Margaret the daughter and onely heire of William Duke of Tancaruille of the houſe of Harcourt in Normandie, by whome they doe enioye the Countie d' Aumale, the Marquiſate d' Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beufe &amp; al other their poſſeſſions in France, except Gin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uille: But becauſe this ladie was crouchbacked and found barren, he forſooke her, and as is aforeſaid, married the Duke of Guelderlands ſiſter, by whome he had iſſue the Duke Anthony, the Duke of Guiſe their father, and the Cardinal Iohn their vncle. Duke Anthonie (as they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend)
<pb facs="tcp:16276:15"/>
was borne during the life of his firſt wife, and left a ſonne named Francis who was father to Charles at this preſent Duke of Lorraine, whom at his deceaſe he left very yong, as hauing ſcarce atteined the third yere of his age. Then (as for the moſt part it ſtil chanceth, that wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes &amp; orphanes are commonly entangled in the ſnares of the wicked and couetous) the Earle of Aumale began to beſtirre him ſeeking to haue founde a dore open into the Duchy, by publiſhing Duke Anthony to be a baſtard: But ſeing that he could not wel bring his purpoſe to paſſe before he had gotten at the leaſt one foote into the ſaid Duchy, he ſought by al meanes poſſible the marriage of Chriſtian the widowe of the late Duke Francis. Howbeit ſhe being both wiſe and of good capacitie, according to the nature of a good mother entending the preſeruation and maintenace both of the country and orphane, aſpired vnto the cuſtodie of the one through the wardſhip of the other, and therfore kept this haſtie wooer in breath, who through her marriage aſſured him ſelfe of the ſame ward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, which afterward might yeld vnto him a fauourable and honeſt entrye vnto the poſſeſſion of this deſired Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chie. And therefore preſently vpon the marriage of their brother the Marquiſe of Maine, al theſe Lords of Guiſe in triumphant wiſe haſted into Lorraine there to put the widowe in ful poſſeſſion of the wardſhip of her ſonne. But ſo ſone as ſhe had gotten her deſired pray, ſhe gaue them a roſemarie wipe, diſmiſſing them &amp; ſending them away with fleas in their eares, vtterly diſapointed of their pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe.</p>
            <p>Hauing therefore thus miſſed of their intent againſt their couſin germaine, (for the Duke of Lorraines father and they were brothers children) they caſt forth their nettes to entrappe their other kinſefolke on the mother ſide, (for likewiſe the King of Nauarre and they were bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers and ſiſters children.)

king of Nauarre: But as a widowe ſtanding in ſome neede of their helpe, coulde cloſely deſpiſe them, euen ſo could a Kings daughter, who regarded not their aid, open<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly diſdaine them: For (ſaid ſhe to King Henry who motio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the matter vnto her) would you my Lord wiſhe that of her, who by duetie ought euen to cary vp my trayne, I ſhould make my ſiſter in Law? either that the daughter of the Ducheſſe of Valentinois ſhould go cheeke by ioule with me? with which anſwere the King found him ſelfe ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſfied, and therefore neuer communed any further with her in that reſpect, which cauſed the Guiſians from that time forwarde to bende their whole driftes againſt him ſelfe, making him finally to pay for their mariage in maner and forme following.</p>
            <p>Hercules d'Eſte Duke of Ferrara, had a daughter whom he loued better then his owne wife: For it is not vnknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en to all the worlde after what maner in her life time he entreated the noble Lady Rene, the daughter of King Lewes the twelfth, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>monly called y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> father of the people: neither is any ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> who had to deale in thoſe daies in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of eſtate, ignora<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t vpon what conſideratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s ſhe was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied vnto ſo many noble perſons who ſued for her mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, &amp; then finally placed in ſo baſe eſtate as was Ferrara. This Duke had I wot not what ſhare in certaine poulders, boulets and munition, with ſuch other like traſh which he had beſtowed to his owne behoofe, &amp; yet now ſought to make our King to pay for the ſame, which in the time of King Francis he coulde not doe, for he knew ouer wel what iugling had therin bene practiſed againſt him. To be briefe, his right herein did this Duke giue in mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age with his daughter, and King Henry payed for it, whoſe lenitie made them to waye downe to much on that ſide, and boldly to vndertake greater matters, whereunto they added yet an other drifte, which was, that acco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>modating themſelues vnto al kinde of pleaſures, or delightes correſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pondent vnto the age of the King, they vſed him as a foun<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dered horſe, or ſtale, ouer whome they might the farther

            <p>During theſe matters, the Lord of Reims gaping after more promotions, whereby he might the better order his intents, through the meanes of the aforeſaid Seneſchall obteyned fauourable letters from King Henry to Pope Paul the thirde, who in that time curryed fauour with all Chriſtian princes, to the end through their ayde to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenged of the Emperour Charles the fifth, for the death of his abominable ſonne Peter Lewes, whereby alſo the Lord of Reims (whome the Seneſchal called but maſter Charles) filled his own bagges with the ſale of his maſters

fauour. By meanes therefore of theſe letters,<note place="margin">Charles made Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinall.</note> about the end of Iulie in the yeare 1547 he was created Cardinal, vpon occaſion whereof vnder pretence as wel of the Council of Boulogne, as alſo of many other affaires which him ſelfe deuiſed, he vndertooke a voiage into Italie, through other two principal motions. The firſt was for the concluding of the mariage aforeſaid of his brother vnto the Duke of Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rara his daughter. The other to the end to ſhew his perſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and ſo be knowen in Rome, whereby he might in time to come the better order his driftes and deuiſes. Being there he tooke vpon him the title of Cardinal of Anjou, but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to what peril, through that preſumptuous folly, he brought him ſelfe, moſt men do knowe. For had not the great Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſchal ſtood his friend, he neuer durſt haue ſhewed his face in France any more, albeit howſoeuer it came to paſſe, he was compelled to leaue his title of Anjou be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the Alpes, and at his returne to accept the ſurname of his anceſtours and country, whereupon we ſhal hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter cal him (as him ſelfe hath eſpecially after his vncles deceaſſe done) the Cardinal of Lorraine.</p>
            <p>At his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming home to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> court he ſo laboured king Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,<note place="margin">The Guiſi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ans dealing with Cardi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nall Iohn their vncle</note> that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Earledome of Aumale was erected into a Duchie therby to haſten the marriage of his brother Francis vnto the aforenamed Duke of Ferraras daughter, which ſhortly after was conſummate. After this time began they to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure their owne aduancements, and to lay the foundation of their tyrannie ouer al men both riche and poore in France. We wil therefore begin with their vncle Cardinal Iohn, who was the inſtrument to tranſlate maſter Charles from the College of Nauarre vnto the Courte. Not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearing vntil that through his deceaſe he might enriche them with his benefices, they neuer left (eſpecially maſter Charles) to pluck fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vnder his elbow al that poſſibly they could, through a kinde of importunatenes not farre diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> meere violence. This good nephue found meanes to make his vncle deſirous to forſake the courte, procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring vnto him ſuch ſeruants as pleaſed him, and fruſtrating
<pb facs="tcp:16276:17"/>
him of thoſe which were the moſt faithful vnder whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer colour he thought beſt, and delt with him in ſuch ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner as that to his power, he ſtripped him euen into his ſhirt: in ſo much that ſhortly a ſoden death (for he liued o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer long for his nephues commoditie) caried him away, at his returne from the election of Pope Iulius the third in the yere 1550. At that time did his nephue become fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous in Rome procuring a Cardinals hat for his brother the Cardinal of Guiſe, the ouerliuer of al the ſix brethren, at which time alſo was ended &amp; conſummate the aforeſaid marriage of the eldeſt brother vnto the daughter of Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rara.</p>
            <p>Hauing thus vnclothed their vncle before he were rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to goe to bed, let vs conſider how they handled him after his death. This man dyed indetted vnto many mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants, but eſpecially of Paris, leauing ſuch welth in mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueable goods as was great, yea and more then ſufficient to haue diſcharged al. After his deceaſſe, his creditors drew toward his nephue the Cardinal of Lorrain, who together with the Cardinal of Guiſe had raked vp al his liuings, but himſelfe alone had ſeaſed vpon al the moueables, to whom he anſwered that he was not his heire: For ſuch men doe neuer accompt him heire, who ſeaſeth vpon the goods, &amp;, as the practitioners do tearme it, do medle with the inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance, but him onely, who ſaith, I am he. But now no man ſpake that word, for the Cardinal of Lorraine ment to haue the goods of free coſt, and as for his brethren, they would not pay becauſe they had not the goods. Againe it is not vnknowen that benefices by a certain rigour of Law are not chargeable with the dettes: If therefore the ſaid Cardinal of Lorraine had at the firſt willed moſt of them to looke for nothing, yet in loſing of their dettes, they ſhould haue bene good gainers, for then ſhould they haue ſaued both their time and coſt, which they waſted in way<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting almoſt two whole yeres, to know the end of this fetch which he cauſed one of his men to playe, to whome he gaue co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>miſſion to peruſe the dettes of the party deceaſed,
<pb facs="tcp:16276:17"/>
and the ſame to verifie, and ſet in order as he tearmed it, with other ſuch like tearmes of practiſe which ſtil were in this commiſſioners mouth. In the meane time they do make an inuentory ſaith one, a deſcription ſaith an other, a remembrance ſayth another, but whatſoeuer it were, among al the dead mans mouables, was to be found in the end, nothing by the report and conſcience of his nephue ſaue a few olde ſtooles and ſettles, with a litle rotten tapeſtrye good to make ſport with al, which to be briefe, was the whole inue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tory of al that, that the Cardinal would not haue: But the ſport was to heare his talke hereupon. Whenſoeuer the merchants of Paris came in his preſence Me thinketh (would he ſay) theſe fleas do bite me an other time, Tuſh they be Engliſhmen, Saluters, or giuers of good morowes. Againe comming to the particulars, To one, he is an vſerer of Paris, to an other, he hath not yet deliuered his wares, to an other, he ſould it for ſix times more then it was worth, to another, he hath receiued ſome money in part of payment, to another, Nothing is dewe, ſignifying you get nothing, which title comprehended the greateſt nomber. But vnto thoſe to whome he ſhewed greateſt fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour, he vſed to ſay, Help to paye your ſelues, not meaning Hold forth your hands and take, but giue and acquite: For when a man had forgiuen halfe, or two third partes, yea three quarters and more, yet looking vpon his booke, he ſhould finde no more receiued, then that which he had acquitted and forgiuen. And for the reſt, Aske would he ſay ſome compoſition, ſome right or priuiledge, or ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thing of the King, and I wil healpe you vnto it, which was as good as if he ſhould haue ſayd to the mercha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts, Go euery one of you kil one or two, and I wil procure your par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dons, for the ſale of the ſettels, ſtooles and tapeſtry was put of vntil the day after domes day. Wherevpon two no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table marchants among other, beholding this ſhamefull dealing, did after diuers motions finally offer, to acquite the party deceaſed of al his dettes for one quarter, or at the moſt, a third part of the yerely reuenue of al his bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices,
<pb facs="tcp:16276:18"/>
and yet could come to no end: part of them neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theles did finally obteine, ſome a quarter, others a fifth part, others a tenth part, ſome more, ſome leſſe, but the greateſt number coulde get nothing at al. And yet for ſo much as ech one did acquitte, al, or at the leaſt the moſt part, were driuen to giue acquittance as for money recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, to what end ech one may ſone perceiue: namely to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraud the creditors of their honour, &amp; the Cardinal of the remembrance and thinking vpon their liberalitie. Thus by litle and litle, he diſpatched away the Marchants of Paris and ſuch others, to the end the more eaſily to fight againſt the mightieſt, and generally againſt al the eſtates of the realme, whome he and his brethren muſt neceſſarilie ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due, before they can attaine to touch the white whereat they do leuel their ſhot.</p>

            <p>Firſt, in as much as neither the worthines of their blood neither their family could preferre them before diuers french gentlemen, but only the prerogatiue of their lands:
<pb facs="tcp:16276:18"/>
therfore to couer the default of their race, they haue cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to erect their ſimple baronages into Duchies, pri<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cipa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities, Marquiſates and Counties, which is the thing that hitherto hath blinded the eyes of the commons, who are vtterly ignorant of matters of eſtate.</p>
            <p>Secondly, they haue endeuoured to make the eſtate of the Peeres (for the Cardinal was one) equal vnto the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, yea, euen to preferre the ſaid Peeres before the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, whereupon happened in the yere 1551 a notable mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, as thus. The court of Parliame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of Paris, had ſent ſix of the chiefeſt members of their body vnto King Henry, to vnderſtand his wil and pleaſure concerning certaine ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles, whereof one was.</p>
            <p>The ſecond point is to enquire of the King, whether it be his pleaſure that my Lordes the princes of the blood, with other great Lords entring into the ſaid Courte, may weare their ſwordes. For time out of mind that hath bene lawful for the King onely, as an eſpeciall prerogatiue of his Royal dignity, who hath the ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d of iuſtice, as being iuſtice himſelf, &amp; mainteyning in aſſured ſafety the miniſters of the ſame. And notwithſtanding ſundry times ſome princes or lordes haue entred with their ſwordes, that hath bene only when comming ſodenly they haue founde the dore open, or els by entring at vnwares: either haue ſo done by the Kings expreſſe commandement, at ſuch time as he hath bene diſpleaſed, or prouoked to wrath againſt his ſaid Court, vpon ſome other occaſions, whereof neuerthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les no rule or cuſtome ought to take place: For contrari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> late King Francis, when he was Dauphin, together w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the Lord Charles of Bourbon comming in, left their ſwordes at the dore, which order King Lewes the twelfth cauſed ſtil to be obſerued. This iudgement of that courte, which according vnto right and equitie preferreth the princes before al lords whomſoeuer, togither with the ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to this day obſerued in the ſame, and the arreſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced againſt their father, did ſo grieuouſly moue the Lords of Guiſe, that to the end to breede ſome debate &amp;
<pb facs="tcp:16276:19"/>
contrarietie, betweene the iudgement of the King &amp; of his ſaid Court of Parliament, alſo to augment their owne cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit, and ſo by litle and litle to exalt them ſelues aboue the Pri<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces, they cloſely practiſed that wheras the ſecretary, ac<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>modating himſelfe vnto the requeſt of the court &amp; the order in the ſame obſerued, had in his rowl (as hi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelf hath ſince teſtified) named the princes firſt, they were neuerthe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>les in the Kings anſwere placed after the Peeres in maner folowing. The Kings pleaſure is that when ſoeuer in his abſence the Peeres of France, the princes of the blood, the Conſtables and Marſhals of France ſhal come &amp; enter into his Court of Parliament, &amp; into the chamber of Audience, whether the dores be open or ſhut, they ſhal neuertheles ſtil weare their ſwordes, the which the ſaid King meaneth not that any other of what eſtate or calling ſoeuer he be ſhal doe. Giuen at Fountainebleau the laſt day of Auguſt in the yere. 1551. ſigned Henry, and contreſigned Du Thier.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, they practiſed a wonderful ſubtiltie, whereby with the time to yelde a kinde of preſcription vnto ſuch principalitie as they ſought to vſurpe. which was in ſeeking to allye themſelues on al ſides, in the moſt high and riche maner that poſſibly they could, and ſo to ſlyde in among the princes, and beare the like port as they. As alſo at the entry of King Henry into the towne of Suſe, Francis Duke of Guiſe preſumed to marche cheeke by ioule with the King of Nauarre the firſt prince of the crowne. Alſo at king Francis the ſecond his firſt comming forth of his chamber in his mourning weed, the ſaid Lord of Guiſe intruded him ſelfe betweene two princes of the blood, to the ende with them to beare vp his traine. Againe, during the reignes of Henry the ſecond, Francis the ſecond and Charles the ninth, and euen at this preſent alſo euery man both hath ſeene and plainely may beholde, with what preſumption the houſe of Guiſe both haue and ſtil do encroche aboue the ſaid princes of the blood, whom they haue oppreſſed and troden vnder foot, as we will more plainely declare, after that we haue yet touched a few matters more, ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
<pb facs="tcp:16276:19"/>
vnto the diſcouery of their raging ambition in this reſpect.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, the houſe of Guiſe being thus aduanced, grew very ſuſpicious and ielouſe of their honour, ſtoutly oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſelues againſt al ſuch as withſtode their atte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pts, as is manifeſt in this. The Fre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>chmen doe ſo highly reuerence their princes, that as they are not to be acco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pted wronged, or in their honours diffamed for any thing that their ſaid princes either doe or ſay vnto them, ſo doe they alſo neuer ſet hand to their ſword againſt the ſaid princes, notwithſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding that any other of what eſtate or calling ſo euer he be, ſtranger or Frenchman, ought to take heede of miſuſing the perſon of any French ge<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tleman, vnleſſe he preſently be minded to receiue at the handes of the partie miſuſed, as much, or rather more then he hath done or ſaid vnto him. Now the more that the lordes of Guiſe haue ſought to become as Princes of France, the more reſiſtance haue they founde, eſpecially duringe the reignes of Francis the ſecond, and Charles the ninthe, neither being as yet quite free from the ſame, as in place ſhall be ſhewed. Let vs therefore conſider ſome examples of the time of Henry. The lord of Rochefort, yongeſt ſonne of the houſe of la Roche-guyon, was on a time chalenged man to man in the Kings garden at Fountainbleau, by Francis Duke of Guiſe, whereas in their talke he ſhewed the ſaid Duke, that he accompted him not as a prince of France, whereof he alſo afterward made him more plaine demonſtration, when as at the onlie countenance, that the Duke of Guiſe made to ſet his ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d vpon his dagger, he the ſaid lord of Rochefort, who was no knight of the order, as now he is, ſet as ſone his hande to his ſworde, and thereby made him to be quiet: which deede both the King and Princes did wel allowe of. This reſiſtance cauſed that the ſame Duke of Guiſe (who thought that the lorde of Montmorency, againſt whom he had a quarell, notwithſtanding he were not as yet Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhall, would doe no leſſe then the other) on a time ſubor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned his great companion the Duke of Nemours, and the
<pb facs="tcp:16276:20"/>
prince of Ferrara, at a place neere vnto the caſtle of ſaint Germain, ſhortly after the Conſtables returne out of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſonment, and then went and plucked the ſaid lord of Montmorency by the cape in the Queenes chamber (the meaning whereof is not vnknowen vnto the gentlemen) who preſently without ſpeaking vnto any man, aroſe and followed him out of the caſtle to the place appointed, where he made him an anſwere correſpondent vnto his demande, accompting him therein no otherwiſe for a Prince then before time: which afterward he ſhewed him more euidently at Paris (Kinge Charles the ninthe being there the ſame time that the meeting was about the edicte of Iulye) in a controuerſie concerning an ayrie of haukes of the foreſt of Compiegne, which the ſaid lord of Guiſe chalenged by prerogatiue: but the ſaid ayrie finally remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned vnto the lord of Montmorency. It is not vnknowen a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain how the Preſide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t Liſet in this point diuers times with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood them: for once in the full audience at the Parliament of Paris, he cauſed to correct y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> qualitie of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Prince, which the Duke of Guiſe in a certain cauſe had taken vpon him. An other time in the preſence of King Henry, he affirmed vnto the Cardinall of Lorraine that he was no Prince, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ought to take place among Princes. Again at another iourney before the ſaid King, in a fooliſh brablinge which the Cardinall made, the ſame Preſident Liſet vſed vnto him theſe wordes. My ſonne and friende, you are yet to yong to vnderſtand thoſe matters, which are no vſuall ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches to be ſaid to any Prince of France, yea he added moreouer theſe wordes, You are no Prince, neither equall with Princes, if therefore you be determined to take vpon you that title, ſhew vs alſo the places of your Principalitie. This yong ſonne was aboue fiue and twentie yeres olde, &amp; already both Peere and Cardinall. The aforeſaid court of Parliament did alſo an other time by ſentence definitiue, expulſe the Duke of Guiſe theſe mens father from his fore ſitting, which by reaſon of his Peereſhippe he chalenged aboue a prince of France. All which notwithſtanding their
<pb facs="tcp:16276:20" rendition="simple:additions"/>
hautineſſe in this point, brake out openlie in diuers wiſe during ſixteene or ſeuenteene moneths, whileſt King Francis the ſeconde reigned, whereof we muſt neceſſarily here note alſo ſome particularities.</p>
            <p>Immediatly after that King Henry was deceaſed, the Duke of Guiſe and the Cardinall of Lorraine conueyed King Francis the ſecond, his brethren, &amp; the two Queenes into the Louure, leauing the Princes of the blood, and the reſt of the great lordes of the Realme, which were not of their faction, behinde to keepe the dead corps: whiles in the meane time, them ſelues permitted no man to come neere the ſaid Francis, or to ſpeake vnto him, vnleſſe at the leaſt one of them were ſtill in preſence, and that ſo dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently, that they neuer let him goe out their ſightes. Then did they alſo driue away the Conſtable, and diſplaced all ſuch as they liked not of, cauſing the King to ſay whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer them ſelues liſted. They found honeſt pretences to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch away the Princes of the blood, by ſending one into Flanders, another into Spayne, and ſo of the reſt, hauing continually ſecret ſeruants and priuy ſpies about them. They changed the eſtates and officers of the Kings houſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holde, orderinge them ſelues with ſuch violence, that a man might (as it were at hie noone) perceiue their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentes. We will now therefore orderly ſhew you what people withſtood them, and in what maner: For ſuch par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular reſiſtance was to ſmall purpoſe, in reſpect of that which followed.</p>
            <p>We muſt now therefore conſider, to what eſtate their ambition haue brought the affaires of France, being ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with couetouſnes, crueltie, vngodlines and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt villanye. I ſay therefore, that ſince the time that they were exalted by meanes of the Seneſchall, conſidering alſo that their children be of a troubleſome and peruerſe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition euen to the ende, they neuer deſiſted from perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuting all ſortes of people high and low in this Kingdome, whereby to ſatisfie their aforenamed paſsions: yea for want of meanes and opportunitie to perſecute them whom they
<pb facs="tcp:16276:21"/>
doe hate, they haue bent their whole rage againſt them ſelues, in ſo much as it is doubtfull to whom they haue done moſt diſpleaſure, whether to their frie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds or enemies.</p>
            <p>We will therefore beginne with ſuch miſchiefes as they haue practiſed, firſt againſt our Kinges, then againſt the Princes of the blood, afterward againſt the great lordes of the Realme, and ſo conſequently we will proceede to the eſtates, namely the Nobilitie, the officers of Iuſtice, the people, the Clergie, their fauorites and friends, and finally vnto their owne iniuries among them ſelues: ſetting forth the whole in as briefe maner as poſſibly we maye, deſiring the readers to quote downe in their bookes, whatſoeuer they perceiue that we haue omitted, to the ende to parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipate the ſame vnto the poſteritie, which thereby ſhall be occaſioned for to abhorre the miſerie of France, which hath ſuffered and borne ſo much, with ouer great reſpect many times of ſuch dangerous monſters. After the ſame maner alſo, according as ſhall be incident in the continua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our diſcours, we will ſomewhat touch their vertues, to the ende eche one may know by what tokens to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber them.</p>

In the time of Francis the firſt, who was ſufficiently acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with their humours, they profited not greatly.

For the ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious couetouſnes of the houſe of Guiſe repleniſhed Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manie, Italie, France, and Flanders with blood, it ſet to ſale to the moſt giuer the lawes of iuſtice, and with infinite exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions

it ſoked the purſes both of rich &amp; poore. With their inſolencies and curſed conſpiracies, they haue alſo defiled the Kings houſe, wherein they haue erected the ſcaffolde, whereupon they haue brought in the horrible tragedies of the deſtruction of France, and there haue heaped vp the ſtacke of wood, which them ſelues did afterward ſo ſore kindle, that the flames and coles thereof doe yet remaine. But this we muſt by litle and litle ouerlooke, wherein we are to recite worde for worde, the lamentations that haue bene made and publiſhed long ſince.</p>
            <p>The great King Francis had lefte France in reaſonable good eſtate: but the houſe of Guiſe, ſmelling out a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand commodities ariſing vnto them ſelues by the warres, could not ſuffer the Realme to continue quyet. It was vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them a gate to aduancement, as was euident by the heate and violence of the eldeſt and third brother, whom the Cardinall neuer doubted to hazarde, knowing that howſoeuer things chanced, his enterpriſe would counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uayle them: again, in caſe they were more happy then wiſe, it were an aſſured meanes to exalte him ſelfe euen to the hieſt place that might be: but if they chanced to be ſlaine, their death ſhould ſerue as a bridge for the reſt to paſſe ouer further, ſo him ſelfe moreouer, hauing the chiefe ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perintendence ouer the treaſures of the Realme, it was more eaſy for to fiſh in pudle then in cleare water. Beſides all this, the Cardinall perceiued that by one kinde of mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, he might both obteine the fauour of thoſe, of whoſe quarell he entended the commoditie of his owne race, at the coſte of the poore commons, and alſo ſhoulde dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhe the Kings forces, whoſe crowne he wiſhed to behold vpon his brothers heade, with the triple Papall crowne v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon his owne. Finally, this was alſo the aſſured meane whereby he might hazarde the King, the Princes of the blood, and all other of whoſe deſtruction depended the increaſing of his honour and power.</p>
            <p>Theſe were therefore the goodly occaſions of this long and curſed warre, which hath bene diſperſed ouer the
<pb facs="tcp:16276:22"/>
whole Realme, whereunto it was no maſtery for them to frame the Kings minde, being of him ſelfe but of ſmall ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, and at his atteining to the crowne, deſirous of newe honour and conqueſt ouer the ſworne enemie of France, who at that time hauing (as it was thought) ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued Germanie, ſeemed terrible to this Realme, vnleſſe ſuch his driftes, as he might haue practiſed there againſt, were ſpeedily cut of, to which end there were three eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall occaſions offered which greatly might hinder him.</p>
            <p>The firſt was the breaking of of the Council of Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dente, whoſe auctoritie the Emperour vſed, in the vniting of all Germany vnto his deuotion, whereby he might af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward both in Italie, and other where doe what him ſelfe thought beſte.</p>
            <p>The ſeconde was the vndertaking of the reſtauration of the houſe of Farneſes, whom the Emperour had expulſed out of Plaiſance.</p>
            <p>The third was the practiſing of the Elector Maurice and the Marquiſe of Bra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>debourges armie, who lying at the ſiege of Maydenbourg, were greatly moued againſt the ſaid Emperour, for the detaining of the Landgraue of Heſſe, witn whom there was ſome likelyhood that the ſonne of the ſaid Landgraue and other Germane Princes would eaſely ioyne. And notwithſtanding that all theſe three de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſes were vtterly repugnant to the Cardinals former pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, which was to be accompted as an aſſured pillar of the Catholike faith: ſeing that by the firſt, he hazarded the King and whole Realme into danger of the Popes curſe and excommunication, and ſo manifeſtly did withſtand the magnificence of the Apoſtolike ſeate, whereof he coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeited ſo earneſt a defender: by the ſeconde, he trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled the quiet of all Europe: and by the third, did openly ioyne the King in league with the Lutherans, who by that meanes ſhould haue better opportunity to multiply and ſtrengthen them ſelues then euer before: all which not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding, this fatall enemy both of God and man, would not therefore quayle, or giue ouer his purpoſe in
<pb facs="tcp:16276:22"/>
any of them all, but motioned King Henry, ouer whom he in effect reigned, to practiſe them all one after an other. This was the originall roote of the proteſtation againſt the Councill, and of the warre of Parma vndertaken againſt the Pope, for the appetite of this proppe of the Papaltie, and at the exceſſiue charges of our poore Realme, all for the commoditie of a baſtarde childe, who ſince hath giuen vs a rewarde correſpondent to the expectation of all wiſe men. Hereof proceeded the firſt cauſes of all the moſt wofull and lamentable calamities, that euer our poore Realme of France did endure: for it was finally expedient that this impoſtume ſhould haue an iſſue, and that theſe furies ſhould raiſe a ciuill warre in Germany, by the which notwithſtanding that God hath chaſtiſed the iniquities of manye, yet haue there thereof proceeded ſo many miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefes and murders, that it is to be marueiled, that the Turke hath not yet taken holde of this occaſion, and ſo paſſed ouer the bridge which the houſe of Guiſe haue buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and ſo come euen into our boſoms. From this roote proceeded their voyage into Germanye, whereas they miſſed of their purpoſe, for God would not permit that countrey to come in their clawes: howbeit ſuch was their cruelty, that their owne country of Lorraine was the firſt that felt the force of their rage, receiuing therein a meete reward for bringing forth ſuch children into the worlde. Their firſt enterpriſe there was ſo to be reuenged vpon the Dutcheſſe the widow of Francis, and mother vnto Charles now Duke, who had diſdayned them, that thereby they hoped to haue intrapped the whole Duchye. To which ende they diſperſed abroad a thouſand ſlanders againſt the ſaid widow, bringing her finally into diſpleaſure with King Henry, neuer ceaſing vntil that vnder pretence of protection (for the moſt notable miſchiefes doe ſtill beare the fayreſt ſhew) the ſaid King had taken the yong Duke into his hands, in ful hope that hauing the King fauourable vnto them, &amp; the Duke &amp; Duchye, as it were, in their owne hands, they might in time hit the marcke, whereat on that
<pb facs="tcp:16276:23"/>
ſide they leueled. But as God in al his works is wonderful, ſo hath he brought to paſſe, that the Duke and Duchie of Lorraine neuer found ſurer or more ſtedfaſt foundations, then the ſame which their couſins of Guiſe had laid in in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to ouerthrowe them. For King Henrie tooke charge of the childe, and afterward made him his ſonne in lawe, committing his Duchie into the hands of his vncle the Earle of Vaudemont. Hereunto adding their practiſes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the towne of Metz, what farther teſtimonie ſhal we neede? For what miſchief is there which this poore towne hath not ſuffred within theſe fewe yeres, both within and without, being vnder colour of protection, bereaued of her libertie, diſmembred from the Empire, for the moſt part deſtroyed, and as a fulneſſe of al miſeries reduced in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the bondage of the Cardinal? who vnder a borowed name, hath yerely wreſted therout at the leaſt a hundred thouſand francks, leauing vnto our King nothing but the diſhonour of ſurpriſing the ſame vnder pretence of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, the charge of keeping of it with ineſtimable ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſes, the loſſe of great numbers of Frenchmen, and the hatred of the Empire, which yerely reneweth the decree of the recouerie of the townes of Metz, Thoul and Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dun, expreſſing therein their deſire at the firſt opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie to reſtore the ſame to their former liberties. For ſoone after enſued the ſiege of Metz aforeſaid, whereas the Cardinal fearing his brothers skinne, and ſeeking to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alte him aboue al men, procured to be ſent vnto him moſt part of the Princes and great Lords of France, for his more aſſurance, and at the price of their bloods to raiſe him as it were vnto the ſhoulders of Victorie it ſelfe: But what neede we to purchaſe the triumphe with the offence both of God and man? or at the charge of the Kings ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and treaſure? Alſo, how ſweetely haue we paied for this ſo valiant defence of a forreine towne, which neuer offended vs, vnleſſe it be an offence to giue ouer haſtie credence vnto the wordes of a Cardinal therein brought vp, whome ſhe accompteth as her biſhop and paſtor? yea
<pb facs="tcp:16276:23"/>
to ſpeake truely, the Frenchmen haue dearely bought the exchange thereof, through the burning and ſpoyle of Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cardie euen vnto Noyon: when as vnder the conduct of the third brother of this race, and ſonne in lawe vnto the great Seneſchal Ducheſſe of Valentinois, the French no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitie receiued the ſoreſt wound that euer it had ſince the battaile of Pauie, becauſe that without anie reaſonable cauſe they were trained thereunto, as to a butcherie ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then a battaile: For in the ſame conflict, wherein the ſaid harebrained Duke of Aumale the third brother was through his owne default taken priſoner, there were ſlaine about two hundred French gentlemen, among whome were ſundrie great Lords, as the Lords of Rohan, S. For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geu, Nancay, la Motte, Duſſeau, the Baron of Couches, &amp; of Caſtres, beſide diuers other Lords of name. Had our whole realme ſuſteined that only loſſe through the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of theſe men, yet were this ſufficient to procure al men to deteſt them. Shortly after this ouerthrowe en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued the ſiege of Metz aforeſaid, from whence the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour being forced to depart, the Duke of Guiſe attribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to him ſelfe the whole glorie, which the Princes and great Lords of France, whome the Cardinal had procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the King to ſend thither, had dearely paide for, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon it is wonderful to ſee how the Guiſians triumphed. Wel, to proceede, what did the next yeres following bring with them, other then two double &amp; irrecuperable loſſes, namely, the vtter ſacke and ſpoyle of Tirwin and Heſdin the two keies of Picardie, by reaſon whereof the Cardinal ſang out his triumphes, ſcoffing at the French nobilitie, who, ſaid he, through default of his brothers aſſiſtance were ouerthrowen by the enemie, perſuading the King that he had no man, but of that race, who was ſufficient to guide the affaires both of peace and warre. Howbeit the impriſonment of the third brother, whome the Marquiſe of Brandebourge held, did ſomewhat reſtraine the courſe of his brags, wherefore they ſought with ſpeede to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawe him home, to the end the one might heaue for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
<pb facs="tcp:16276:24"/>
the other: and yet were them ſelues vnwilling to diſbourſe anie penie of al their briberies and theftes, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to take anie compaſsion of the French nation, which was deuoured to the hard bones. They inuented therfore an other reaſonable honeſt ſhift, as they ſuppoſed, which was to borowe the Kings name and authoritie, whereby they might vnder pretence of hereſie, vexe and torment whome ſo euer they thought beſt, to the end to meete with ſome confiſcations. For it ſeemed not ſufficient for him, through his temeritie and raſhnes to be the cauſe of the death of ſo manie great Lords, and gallant French gentlemen, at his owne taking: but now his ranſome muſt be gathered out of the liues of ſuch as remained, not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearing the wiues of ſuch good and vertuous Captaines, as in the meane ſeaſon ventured their liues and goods in the Kings ſeruice. Whereof the Lord of Teligny might haue bene a ſufficient witnes, had he not ſhortly after loſt his life in King Henries ſeruice: For during the impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Duke of Aumale, the vertuous Ladie of Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligny was vniuſtly accuſed of hereſie, at the inſtance of a Sorboniſt one of the Cardinals ſtalions, as are the reſt of our maſters his companions, who be men ignorant of all goodnes and honour, as fierce, cruel and ſeditious, as any aliue, vſing religion as a cloke to couer their peruerſitie, in this reſpect altogether like vnto the Cardinal of Lorraine the ſetter of them on worke at the coſt of the Kings ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, who for that cauſe incurred the euil wil of many. In this fetch they diſcloſed an other of their ſleightes, for what with their ſpunge which was laid cloſe to King Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries ribbes, namely the Ducheſſe of Valentinois this pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners mother in lawe, who by al meanes robbed him on the one ſide, &amp; them ſelues who ruled the common purſe, they wholy ſpoyled the King both of the loue, and of the goods of his ſubiectes, araying them ſelues in the ſame, perſuading him that nothing was wel done, but what them ſelues did. Yea they waxed ſo impudent, as to affirme that their brother had verie wel diſcharged his duetie, alſo that
<pb facs="tcp:16276:24"/>
they whom he had led to the ſlaughter, had in maner be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traied him, inſomuch that the whole fault was imputed vnto the dead, and he the ſuruiuer, who had diſobeyed the Kings commandement, who ſent him word not to hazard any thing, after his deliuerie returned to the court, where by the meanes of his mother in law, he was as much or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther more cheriſhed and made of, then any of the luſtieſt lieutenants that the King had. Thus did they on the one ſide laugh King Henry to ſcorne, whome in the meane time they had ſo artificially bewitched, that he accompted him ſelfe to haue none more aſſured or faithful ſeruants, then the ſaid lords of Guiſe, except the Conſtable, whom therefore they hated to the death, as they afterward de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared in diuers wiſe.</p>
            <p>Theſe warres of Metz were nothing in reſpect of thoſe of Picardie, wherof the houſe of Guiſe were the kindlers, which alſo ſo long as the Duke of Guiſe and the Cardinal had the dealings about King Henry, waxed ſtil more and more yet were they not content to hazarde that part of the Kings eſtate, who thereby loſt Tirwine and Heſdine together with many great lordes and gentlemen, beſides priſoners of name: but they alſo procured to him an other great blowe in Italie. It is not therefore requiſite that we ſhould here rehearſe al our damages, and loſſe of battailes wherein were ſlaine foure or fiue thouſand Frenchmen, together with the Captaines and gentlemen of Name: neither the loſſe of the citie of Siene, which hath coſt this realme ſo much money, buried ſo manie frenchmen, and beautified Florence with our ſhame, neither the bringing of the poore inhabitants thereof into perpetual bondage, and in a maner vtter deſtruction: for to whome is al this more iuſtly to be imputed, then vnto the ielouſie of the ſaid Lordes of Guiſe who then gouerned al things, (This happened in the yeres 1554. and 1555.) when they deſired rather to deferre the promiſed aide, and ſo to put the whole armye in deſpaire, then to ſuffer it to be reported, that without them the King had gotten Tuſcane, or at the
<pb facs="tcp:16276:25"/>
leaſtwiſe compelled the inhabitants to come to ſuch com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition as him ſelfe woulde haue graunted them.</p>
            <p>Theſe Lords of Guiſe did in the meane time frame ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry conſpiracies in Italie, whereby ſomewhat the more to increaſe their owne honour: and al with the treaſure of the realme, and vnto the Kings confuſion. It is not vnkno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wen how they quareled for the crowne of Naples &amp; Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, neither how the Cardinal al his life time gaped after the Papaltie, perſwading him ſelfe to procure wonderfull and ſtrange alterations, in caſe he might once atteine to be God vpon earth. And ſo ſoone as the olde Pope was deceaſed, the Cardinal prouoked through his wonted am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition, went not reaſonably, but ranne ſo faſt as poſſibly he coulde, to catche vp the triple crown, which imaginatiue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with a vaine hope he did already deuoure. At that time did experience teach the French nation, that this man where euer he became, drew al miſchief after him. For im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly after his departure, the Emperour Charles y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> fifth &amp; King Henry were ſone inclined to yelde vnto the better cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſels, of ſuch as ſpake of quietnes to be granted vnto the pore people, in ſo much y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> notwithſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding the peace might be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cluded, yet through the graue aduice of the Conſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and the Admiral, there was the fifth day of February, in the yere 1556 an abſtinence and truce agreed vpon for fiue yeres. This Cardinal according to his wonted ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, minded not to goe his iourney to Rome at his charge, and therefore had aſſured King Henry, that in Italie he would practiſe ſuch leagues againſt the Emperour Charls, that then he might eaſely be ouercome, which, the King liking of it, ſtood the Cardinal in ſteade, as a couer to hide his ambition and couetouſnes, who with many circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ces (ſtil at the realmes charges) made Hercules the ſeco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d Duke of Ferrara, the Kings lieutenant general in Italie: But his chiefe drift was, to make friends, and entertaine ſeruants, through whoſe aide together with the power &amp; treaſure of France, he might conquere the Papaltye for him ſelfe, and the realmes of Naples and Sicil for his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
<pb facs="tcp:16276:25"/>
So ſoone therfore as he was aduertiſed of the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid truce, he was with the ſame greatly diſpleaſed, for that it was the aſſured death of all his driftes in that reſpect, in ſo much that he could not reſtraine his ſpeach before di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers, but ſaid openly as he paſſed through Neuers, that this was not it that the King had promiſed him: alſo that he knew a meane to breake this truce, fully perſwading him ſelfe ſo to doe, immediatly vpon his comming to the Court, which then lay at Bloys: whereas ſo ſoone as he was arriued, and had ſpoken with the King, he finally ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teined through the meanes of his clients, and eſpecially of Cardinal Carasfa, (whom the Pope had ſent to preſent the King with a rich ſword,) a graunt to breake the truce, notwithſtanding whatſoeuer reaſons the Conſtable, Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miral and other great Lords could alleage. The Guiſians principal inſtrument was the Ducheſſe of Valentinois, who was to them a bridge both in body and minde, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer to paſſe vnto the Royal throne, for ſhe commaunded King Henry, and they commaunded her.</p>
            <p>Hereby did they intangle the King in open periury, &amp; the realme in new troubles, procuring the ouerthrow on S. Laurence day, the taking of S. Quintins, the ſpoile of Picardie, and the peace vnprofitably concluded for the French nation. None but the Guiſians hoped for any com<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>moditie of this newes: for the eldeſt of them aſpiring vnto the Crowne of Naples and Sicill, procured for him ſelfe a commiſſion, to goe and breake the truce in Italie, accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied with ſix thouſand Swithers, foure thouſand Fre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ch men, fiue hundred men of armes and fiue hundred light horſes. It is not vnknowen to al men, that he tranſported with him al the beſt ſouldiers that he could get, leauing, according to King Francis prophecie, his ſonne Henry in his doublet, and his ſubiects in their ſhirts. For beſides ſo many men whom he led away, the Cardinal (who had the ouerſight of the treaſury) had ſo ſoked the ſame, that final<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the King was brought to that ſtay, that through perſons (who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Cardinals couetouſnes had brought forth) inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed,
<pb facs="tcp:16276:26"/>
the King was driuen to borowe the money, which proceeded from his owne treaſury. Moreouer the rowles and records of that time, and of the next yere following, wil declare what exceſſiue rewardes the ſaid Cardinal, &amp; his brother did wreſt forth of the Kings lenitie, while in the meane time the commons were vnco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſcionably pilled, the treaſury (as is aforeſaid) waſted, the demaines, receits and cities morgaged, the warre reuiued, and the coaſt of Picardy come into the King of Spaines hands. For the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpriſes of Henry, who then followed the onely aduice of the Cardinal, were ſo wide from proſperous ſucceſſe, that within ſhort ſpace after, he loſt the lamentable battel vpon S. Laurence day, wherein were ſlaine Iohn of Bourbon Duke of Anghien, the Vicounte of Turaine, beſides many other French lordes and gentlemen, the footmen for the moſt part hewen in pieces, and the Conſtable taken priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, beſides a great number of other valiant lordes and gentlemen. Againe, within twelue or fiftene dayes after, was the towne of S. Quintins taken by aſſault, whereby the King there alſo ſuſteined a ſhrewd foyle.</p>
            <p>We muſt not here ouerſlippe a teſtimonie of the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinals good wil, toward King Henry and his eſtate, as this. After the ouerthrowe of S. Laurence daie, the King being deſtitute of men, money and counſaile, (for as the miſchief was, the Cardinal only was left about him) this reuerend father, in ſtead of helping the King with his goods, or of relieuing his neceſsitie with ſuch coyne, as he had fiſhed out of the ſaid Kings reuenues, euen the next day after this miſchance, enforced the treaſurer of the purſe to pay him the moſt part of a ſumme of fiftene thouſand francks, which he pretended to be due vnto him. Throughout the whole realme there remained not ſo meane an artificer, or ſo poore a citizen, who was not contributorie vnto the Kings reliefe, and for the ſame cauſe was not moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treemely delt with al, whileſt in the meane time the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal becomming a ſergeant, executed King Henry in the chiefeſt time of his miſerie, and when his affaires were in
<pb facs="tcp:16276:26"/>
greateſt danger, dalying with the ſpoyled King with ſuch impatie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cie, that he would not forbeare vntil the ſaid trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurer of the purſe had gathered vp ſo much money, but draue him to borowe the ſame ſumme wherwith to ſatiſfie his requeſt. Alſo at the ſame time the king obteined in the name of a gift of the citie of Paris, the ſumme of three hundred thouſand franckes, whereof the Cardinal had the diſpoſing, which, how or whereabout they were em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed God knoweth. Let this therefore be ſufficiently ſpoken for a ſimple proofe of infinite ſuch like practiſes, wherby it is to be doubted in which of theſe two the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal did moſt exceede, either in vnreaſonably hoarding together, or in exceſſiue appetite to waſt al France, which he had choſen as a pray conuenient for his ambition.</p>
            <p>But how was the Duke of Guiſe occupied in Italie, (while the French nobilitie was in the King of Spaines priſons) in laying the foundation of the greatnes (though inuiſible) of theſe our Lords and maſters? The Duke had led with him a reaſonable number of noble men, and had dried vp al the Kings reuenues, endeuoring in the meane time nothing in Italie, ſauing that for the augmentation of his brothers credite, and the practiſing of conſpiracies vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der colour of ſimplicitie, he went with his famous principa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie to proſtitute the dignitie of one of the king of France his lieutenants general in Rome, to dallie among prieſts, &amp; to make vp a lower meſſe and laſt ſeruice at the table of Cardinals, of whome the chiefe part are but the Popes Marmoſets and Apes. Whereupon ſundrie haue commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the free ſtomacke of one of the maſters of requeſts that accompanied him in the ſaid voyage, who miſliking of the ſaid Duke of Guiſes behauiour, without anie leaue of the Cardinalitie, ſate downe gallantly by the Dukes ſide, leaſt it ſhould haue bene reproched vnto the Frenchmen, that the Kings lieutenant general had ſerued as a cloke bearer vnto ſuch lickorous griediguttes of the Popes cauldron, who vpon their owne dunghil do ſo light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly accompt of Chriſtian Kings and Princes. But what of
<pb facs="tcp:16276:27"/>
this? It was neceſſarie that France with the coſt and loſſe of men ſhould put vp yet two iniuries more in Italie. The one by the ſaid Lord of Guiſe, who left his campe idle, and his maſters buſines vndone, to the end to loyter and dau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce after the Popes court, there to create (as the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinals hope was he would) ſome and ſo manie new Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals after his brothers minde, that in caſe the Papaltie ſhould be voyd, he might be as certaine to ſucceede in the ſaid roume as a Cardinals faith could extend. The other through the follie of the ſaid Duke of Guiſe, in that in his owne perſon being a lieutenant general, he permitted his Kings honour and reputation ſo ſhamefully to decay: The enemies of the crowne laughed hartily at ſuch his foliſhe ambition, &amp; the wiſeſt Frenchmen ſuppoſed that the King &amp; the Conſtable had ſuffred the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſelues to be intangled in ſuch enterpriſes, to the end to be releaſed of an intolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble burden, hanging co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinually vpon their armes through ſuch continual alarmes, as the inconſtancie, couetouſnes, &amp; vaine glorie of the Guiſians did daily miniſter vnto the Kings affaires, exceeding the coſt of two ſuch conqueſts. Now the Cardinals drift was, ſo ſone as he were Pope, to tranſport the warres into Naples &amp; Sicil, which conqueſt was the way to haue ouerthrowen their whole race, or els in achiuing their enterpriſe (wherein France ſhould haue wonne more then by keeping them vpon her hands as ſhe hath done) to haue bound them ſelues for their life time a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout their neckes, a bonde of the maintenance and kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping of their new conquered dominions. Howbeit vnder this pretence the Cardinal pinched at al aſſaies, inſomuch that for this cauſe and others, he ieſted with them in good earneſt, who ſo cunningly turned the letters of the name of Charles of Lorraine, that thereby he found this which truely we might reproch vnto him to be moſt true. RA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CLE AS L'OR DE HENRIE, ſignifying, <hi>Thou hast ſcraped away al Henries golde.</hi> But hereof we wil ſpeake ſome what more particularly.</p>
            <p>Proceding therefore in our matter, after the loſſe of ſo
<pb facs="tcp:16276:27"/>
manie men at S. Laurence battaile, together with the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of the Conſtable, and other contrarie chances, the Cardinal finding (as he ſuppoſed) the beſt occaſion poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble offered for the aduancement of his familie, diſplaied at that preſent his whole witte toward the execution of his purpoſes. The firſt was by making his brother in effect during the reigne of King Henrie, a King: The other ſo wel to wrappe his yuie about the pinakle, that finally the one might ouerthrow the other, which was by motioning a double alliance: the one, of his niece Marie Stuard Queene of Scots vnto Francis King Henries eldeſt ſonne, the other was of his couſin Charles Duke of Lorraine vnto the Ladie Claude of France. Againe, the Conſtables abſence, of whome the Cardinal ſtoode in great awe and feare, whom alſo marueilouſly he hated, did altogether hearten him on.</p>
            <p>As for the firſt point, the affayres being troubled in Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cardie, and the realme voyde of forces, the Cardinal thought it beſt to cal home thoſe that before were ſent in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Italie: &amp; the whiles to watch, leaſt any other ſhuld haue vndertaken the ſuperintendence &amp; ruling of the affaires, hoping (ſeing the Conſtable detained) to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mit the ſame into the hands of his brother the Duke of Guiſe, preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vpon his returne: who about the ſame time had bene repulſed from before Ciuitella, ſo that this commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment came fitly to him: The eſquire Scipio alſo was ſent to haſten him away, and to wil him to bring his power with him: being come, the Cardinal cauſed him preſently to be ſent to Compiegne there to muſter the armie, whither as the King ſhortly after followed him, publiſhing in the preſence of his knights of the order, and Captaines of his armie, that the Duke of Guiſe was come in fit time to preſerue his realme, and minded to haue made him Vice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roy, or vnder King of France: but foraſmuch as that title ſeemed ſtrange, he commanded to diſpatch him a warrant for the Kings lieutenant generalſhippe throughout al the ſaid Kings dominions: the which du Thyer ſecretarie of
<pb facs="tcp:16276:28"/>
commandements ſoone made in ſuch maner as it pleaſed the Cardinal to deuiſe, being alſo afterward receiued and verified by the court of Parliament of Paris, and ſundrie other Parliaments of the Realme, whereby the Princes of the blood were contemptuouſly put backe: as alſo af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the taking of Calais they procured the preferring of the Duke of Neuers before the Prince of Conde, concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the charge of the light horſemen: Yea, within a yere after, the Marſhal Briſſac was alſo preferred before the ſaid Prince of Conde in the gouernment of Picardie.</p>
            <p>The Duke of Guiſe hauing gotten this commiſſion, and men ouer whom to commande, ſwelled manifeſtly in pride, whiles in the meane time the Cardinal playing vpon his harpe in the middeſt of all theſe broyles lulled King Henry on ſlepe in the boſome of the villainouſe Seneſchall.

He nourriſhed the warres of Picardie and Italie, he brake the truce, he with his brother gouerned all for the ſatisfying of his ambition, and preparing of his path to proceede fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and yet was not all this ſufficient. He muſt therefore trye ſome other meanes. The Ducheſſe of Lorraine motio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned ſome peace with King Philippe, whereof the Cardinal taking his aduantage, as ſhortly we ſhall perceiue, procured to him ſelfe the commiſſion to goe to her, to the end there to finde out ſome other meanes, which was this. The biſhop of Arras now called Cardinall Granuelle, being come as the King of Spaynes deputie to this enteruiew, alleaged among other things, that France was infected with Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therans, among whom ſome were euen of the chiefeſt lordes, naming the lord d'Andelot, adding alſo that ſome of the Princes were of the ſame profeſſion, who by meanes thereof lay in wayte for the crowne, whereunto they might eaſely attaine through the ayde and ſupporte of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes, as lately he had perceiued. Theſe words were not ſpoken in waſt: for the Cardinal thereby deſirous to frame ſome practiſe, diſcloſed to Granuelle all that he knew tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching certaine offers which the Proteſtante Princes had made to King Henry, togither with the meetings there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon betwene the King of Nauarre and them. This ſpake he now to the ende to heare the others opinion, knowing that vnleſſe he found ſome occaſion to ſtirre vp houſholds in France, his owne driftes would be in vaine, &amp; his family come to decaye. Gra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uelle on the other ſide, conſidering of what importance in his maſters affaires the breaking of theſe practiſes with the Proteſtantes might be, togither with the Cardinall of Lorraine layed this foundation of peace: namely that their maſters were either of them of
<pb facs="tcp:16276:29"/>
ſuch force, that in caſe the one ſhould ouerthrowe the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, a third perſon might eaſely ouercome the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>querer, and therefore that it was neceſſary to agree them in ſuch maner, that with their whole power they might together ſet vpon theſe goſpellers, thereby to get the recompence for their owne loſſes, firſt putting to death all ſuch as were within the iuriſdictions of both princes, not ſparing any. For the Cardinall of Lorraine hoped that the Princes and great lordes of France (which were thought to be Luthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rans) being dead, the King and Realme ſhould thereby be ſo weakened that his family might with leſſe trauaile and coſte enioye the ſame. Alſo that their confiſcations might be employed to the winning of ſeruants and friendes. But that which moſt of all encouraged him to vndertake this matter, was that Granuelle ſhewed him, that he knew no knight or captaine liuing more honoured and regarded then the Duke of Guiſe, who therefore was moſt worthy of ſuch a commiſsion. For preſently he began in a fooliſh kinde of vaine hope to ſwallow vp whole countries and kingdomes, perſwading him ſelfe to ſtrike his ſtroke vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the goodlieſt pretence poſsible, namely the zeale of Religion, all which was but the deſtruction of Henry, his eſtate and ſucceſſion. For the Cardinall hauing once roo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted this principall propoſition in our Kings hearts, namely that they ought to ſtrayne their conſciences, alſo that vnto Heretikes they were not to obſerue any faith, thereby he ſtrooke two wonderfull blowes. firſt, he drew to him moſt of the Catholike great lordes, eſpecially the Conſtable &amp; others very affectionate protectours of France, whom he made his executioners in cutting of their owne armes and legges, by perſecuting their fellow citizens. Secondly, he ſhould thereby make away the Princes, many noble lords, ſundry gentlemen &amp; infinite true Fre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>chmen, who togither yelded the crowne impregnable, and terrible in the eyes of their enemies. But vnder theſe two fetches are hidden ſo many ſlights and practiſes, as that it is vnpoſsible to name them all, wherefore we will heare rehearſe ſome, to the
<pb facs="tcp:16276:30"/>
ende the readers may the better call the reſt to minde, not forgetting how that ſince that the Cardinall had found this doore open, neither the King, neither his ſucceſſours had euer any reſt, becauſe they haue giuen ouer them ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues vnto ſuch pernicious counſayle as hath bene alſo the deſtruction of the Cardinall him ſelfe, and of moſt parte of his abettours and ſupporters, and vndoubtedly will in time intrappe his whole family and progenie: in as much as it is the will of God the iuſt iudge, that into the pitte which the wicked haue digged, them ſelues ſhall firſt fall, and ſo be enſnared in the net that they haue pitched for others, and finally be ſtrangled with the ſame coarde that they haue twiſted for their neighbours.</p>
            <p>To conclude, the peace was granted to the great preiu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice of France, but the Cardinall forced not of the price, ſo that it might in any wiſe ſerue his purpoſe. The firſt article imported, that both the Kings ſhould procure a generall council, wherewith to repreſſe all hereſies, which was as much to ſay, as after that the Pope and his adherents had concluded thereupon, they ſhould on all ſides aſſayle the Lutherans, wherein the Duke of Guiſe ſhould be one of the firſt that ſhould be ſet on worcke. As for the reſt of the articles, they were ſuch, as that by the report of moſt men, the Cardinall in them ſhewed him ſelfe ſo faithfull vnto the King of Spayne, that moſt of them proceeded in his fauour, without any, or at the leaſt with very ſimple con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouerſie. And notwiſtanding both the Conſtable and Marſhall of S. Andrewes were ioyned in commiſsion with him, yet did both he and Granuelle extremely proſecute the King of Spaynes co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>moditie. As for the Conſtable, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding he plainly beheld the open wrong offered to his maſter, &amp; did ſomewhat ſmell out the Cardinals intent, yet through an earneſt deſire which he had to returne into France, there to repreſſe (through his credite with King Henry) the ambition of the ſaid Guiſians, who in his opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion tooke their flight ouer high, the effects whereof were partly diſcouered in the practiſe of the mariage of their
<pb facs="tcp:16276:30"/>
niece, for he began to feare leaſt this fire ſhould take ſuch hould, as that in time it could hardly be quenched, did therefore eaſely permit him ſelfe to be drawen away after the Cardinals lure in theſe affaires.</p>
            <p>And the Marſhall of S. Andrewes was no ſuch man as durſt withſtand the Cardinall: for hauing obteined his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour through ſuch meanes as al men wot, it was no newes though his mind were ſeruile and his hearte of ſmal force or courage. Alſo although the Cardinall miſtruſted that the Kings earneſt affectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vnto the Conſtable would pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure, that preſently vpon his returne he ſhould becom eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peciall &amp; principall counſaylour vnto him, yet accounting the peace, as the briefeſt and moſt ready way to haſten the courſe of his thoughts, he earneſtly purſued the publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation thereof.</p>

The very ſtones, cabbins and hangings of the houſe of Reims, wherein infinite whooredomes haue bene committed, doe yet ſpeake of the ſame: yea not content to entertaine about his perſon the Ducheſſe of Valentinois, to the Queenes great griefe and ſpite, they did through other inferiour ſeruants entiſe other ladies &amp; gentlewome<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> on al ſides, to the end through ſuch accurſed meanes to winne the fauour of this prince through the loſſe of his ſoule. We wil not here ſpeake of the filthie and foule adultery which they procured him to commit at his returne out of Piedmont, while he was yet Dauphine, neither of that, that they haue brought vnto him ſuch as belonged very neere vnto them ſelues, to the end he might take his pleaſure with them, that is, pollute him ſelfe in ſundry and ſtrange wiſe. How oft hath the Car<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dinal fretting at his brother the Duke of Guiſe, ſaid vnto him, that neuer uckold ſung faire ſong? Let others weye with them ſelues whom he touched. Peraduenture Henry had companions, but he was the firſt loſt in theſe filthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, through the dealing of theſe men. Hereof it came that for the deſtruction both of his body and ſoule, ſoone after his comming to the crowne, they inuented a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand meanes to entertaine him in wantonnes, and turning
<pb facs="tcp:16276:32"/>
his minde from God, in ſucceſſion of time to ſet al in trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, whereby themſelues might fiſh the better. We muſt therefore view ſome particularities. Queene Katherine de Medicis remained barrein ſundry yeres, wherof King Hen<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ry being yet Dauphine was very ſorowful. Theſe our lords hereupon hauing brought in the Seneſchal, endeuoured to procure Henry to ſend home his wife into Italie. Yea, once at Roſſillon vpon Roſne they helde a great parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in ful determination to ſend home this Queene, who afterward was wel aſſiſted by the Cardinal of Chaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tillon in the ſame matter. Then ſeemed ſhe an earneſt Chriſtian. on the one ſide, the Bible was ſtil vpon the table wherein ſometime her ſelfe read, ſometime ſhe cauſed o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers to reade: On the other ſide, it chanced that vpon the commandement of the great King Francis, Clement Marot had tranſlated thirtie pſalmes into French, which were ſet in muſicke by ſundry good muſitions, for both the King and the Emperour Charles the fifth had allowed of this tranſlation, as appeared both in their wordes and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards: But whoſoeuer loued or feruently embraced them, ordinarily either ſinging or cauſing them to be ſoung, this yong Prince Henry then Dauphine was nothing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind, wherupon the Godly praiſed God, and his minions, yea the Seneſchal her ſelfe counterfeited a loue of them, &amp; would ſay to him, My lord, Shal not I haue this? you ſhal giue me that if it pleaſe you. Wherby ſometimes he had e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to do to ſatiſfie both his own fancy and theirs alſo. Howbeit he eſpecially kept for him ſelfe the hundred &amp; eight and twentieth Pſalme, beginning thus, Bleſſed art thou that feareſt God, &amp;c. Whereto himſelfe ſet a tune, both verie pleaſant and correſpondent vnto the wordes. The ſame did he ſo often ſing, and cauſe to be ſung, that euery man might thereby perceiue howe deſirous he was to be bleſſed in ſtocke, as that pſalme doeth importe. Shortly hereafter the Dauphine multiplied in children: but her huſband Henrie in ſteade of acknowledging ſuch a benefite, began to followe the abominations of this vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanous
<pb facs="tcp:16276:32"/>
Seneſchal, doing worſe then before, ſo that I may (as I ſuppoſe) ſay this bleſſing was turned into a curſe, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto the Cardinal of Lorraine was a fit inſtrument: For he perceiuing that Henrie delited in theſe holie ſongs, which are the bulworkes of chaſtitie, and capital enemies vnto al filthines, fearing leſt thereby with the time he might be wonne the better to loue his wife, and to ſend away his harlot, and ſo conſequently the credite of my Lords of Guiſe, being builded vpon ſo filthie a foundation ſhoulde fall downe, began firſt to reproue the tranſlation, and then the Pſalmes them ſelues, ſubſtituting in their ſteades the laſciuious verſes of Horace, together with other fooliſhe ſongs and abominable loue matters of our French Poets whome he brought into credit. Then began Ronſarde, Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delle, Baife, and other vile Poets to come into eſtimation. And God no longer permitted his Name to be ſo propha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, but plucked away his praiſes, to the end to commit them to the mouthes of infants and babes. The Pſalmes, and Marot him ſelfe were together baniſhed. Al kinde of vile ſongs and laſciuious muſike tooke place, through the eſpecial fauour of the Cardinal the Mecenas to al theſe villanous inuenters. And the better to end al their labour, they through the Seneſchal tooke from the King al godly muſike, and depriued the Queene of her chaplaine Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teyler, who in thoſe daies preached the word ſyncerely, gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing vnto King Henrie a Sorbonical doctor of their owne, a man both ignorant and wicked euen to the end, and ſo plucked out of his heart, that litle ſparke of godlines which peraduenture was entred therinto. Afterward, they became King Henries companions, eſpecially after he was King, yea in more wiſe then honeſtie could endure. Here therefore to rehearſe and ſtirre vp ſuch villanies, it were but to much to trouble the readers: Let ſuch therefore as can call to minde all the time paſſed, ſince the yere 1550. euen vnto death, with me reduce before their eies the wicked practiſes which the Guiſians haue practiſed vpon this poore Prince. Firſt in the deſtructio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of his ſoule,
<pb facs="tcp:16276:33"/>
maintaining a harlot in his boſome, and behauing them ſelues ſo vnworthilie in his ſeruice, as that willingly I wold to God I had neuer heard ſpeaking thereof. The verie ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blets made and preſented vnto the Cardinal him ſelfe, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with his countenances and maners of behauiour haue ſufficiently ſhewed it. Againe, what goodnes haue they done to the Queene? Nay, what euil haue they not committed againſt her? Henrie left foure ſonnes aliue. Firſt, how they dealt with Francis, we ſhal preſently per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue. What confuſions haue we through their meanes bene toſſed withal, during the raigne of Charles? Or if the Cardinal liued, how would he handle Henry the third through the meanes of Queene Louyſe of Lorraine? Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued he the Duke of Alenſon? Nay, but contrariwiſe at the Kings departure into Poland, he defrauded the ſaid Duke of the lieutenantſhippe, conferring the ſame to his nephue the Duke of Lorraine, and vnder colour thereof gouerned more malepartly then euer before. But al theſe iniuries do require a more exact diſcourſe, which hereafter we will looke vpon. Thus therefore hauing ſcorned Henrie and al his, they haue repleniſhed his houſe with abominations, and his realme with troubles, they haue deſtroyed the mightie, entrapped the meane ſort, and brought al things into ſuch confuſion, that in mans iudgement the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome is paſt al hope of reſtauration, or being reduced to anie ſmal forme of the priſtinate and auncient glorie. In this Prince Henrie the ſeconds life time, alſo they began to note out ſuch of his ſeruants as diſpleaſed them, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſing ſome of them abroad, bringing others into diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure, remouing fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the King his faithful counſailers &amp; bringing in their own minions &amp; bondme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, through whoſe meanes this Prince was perſuaded that the Lords of Guiſe were his moſt truſtie and faithful ſeruants, who ſowed diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſion among the other Princes and great Lords, to the end that drawing the one partie vnto their ſide, they might with the leſſe labour deſtroy the other. All theſe particularities ſhal better be ſeene hereafter in their or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
<pb facs="tcp:16276:33"/>
whereby theſe iniuries ſhal plainely be perceiued. At this preſent thus much we wil ſay, which alſo al true Frenchmen wil ſtand vnto: that conſidering the breuitie of King Henries life, he did them in ſo ſhort time more good, then anie King his predeceſſor did euer vnto al his whole houſhold together: he ſuffred more, he bare more with them, indured more ſorowe, grief, vnduetiful beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiours, loſſes and hinderances by them, then euer maſter, friend or father ſuſteined at the hands of their ſeruants, companions, or children. For beſides that while he liued, they infinit waies and times, turned away from him, ſeking the deſtruction of both his bodie and ſoule to their pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, they haue alſo contaminated his houſe, marred his children, and conſumed his people: euen at his death they haue ſhewed what regard in his life time they had vnto him. We heard before how the eldeſt brother perceiuing the death of the great King Francis at hand, ſcorned him, calling him yoncker. They al now haue bene nothing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind, but haue vttered many more ſignes of diſobedience, and of their trecherous hearts toward King Henrie at his death, who was their eſpecial friend, natural Lord and mightie benefactor. What a ſight was it to the French nation bewayling the ſo vntimely and vnlooked for death of their Prince, to beholde at the ſame inſtant of his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaſſe, the Duke of Guiſe and the Cardinal of Lorraine with ioyful countenances, taking their yong King and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phue, and tranſporting him from the Tournelles vnto the Louure? Yea, there was one who ſemed to name that day, and that not impertinently, the Euen of the feaſt of three Kings. For there was no man ſo ignorant, but that viewing theſe Lordes on horſebacke, might wel iudge that France ſhould now haue the King inheritour, King in name only, and the two Lords of Lorraine Kings in effect, or at the leaſt, two craftie and cruel tyrants, a ſince they haue ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſted them ſelues. Moreouer it is the duetie of the great chamberlaine to take the charge ouer the dead Kings corpes vntil it be buried: Now the Duke of Guiſe was
<pb facs="tcp:16276:34"/>
great chamberlaine, for he had euen in maner forcibly ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken the ſame office from the houſe of Longueuille. Who then letted the Duke of Guiſe and Cardinal of Lorraine, hauing a King at their deuotion, yea, if we may ſo ſay, at their commandement, from doing their dueties, but that needes they muſt preſently forſake the corpes as ſome fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie carrion? What may be ſaid of them that ſo ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully abandoned the corpes of their King and Lord, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing caring or thinking vpon the garde and burial of the ſame? for the which cauſe both the Conſtable and al other the Kings truſtie &amp; faithful ſeruants remained ſtil behind. Yea, if they had but ſtayed vntil the bodie had bene colde and aſſuredly dead, or at the leaſt if they had but ſhewed ſome countenance of ſorow. Howbeit peraduenture this inhumanitie proceded of that they had gotten ſome inck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling that King Henrie was minded to driue them away, preſently after the triumphes and feaſtes were ended: or rather their owne ambition permitted them not long to deferre the diſcouerie of that which their hearts conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, which was, vnder the name of their nephue Francis to raigne ouer vs, waiting better occaſion to proceede. Well peraduenture they dealt better with Francis the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, and ſo behaued them ſelues, that now they deſerued to haue their former offences concealed. Let vs therefore ſee whether it be ſo or not.</p>

The people, the officers of iuſtice and euen the Clergie them ſelues could haue aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red them ſelues of no other then moſt horrible tyrannie.
<pb facs="tcp:16276:34"/>
To the end therefore, that all this may the more euidently be perceiued, let vs marcke the ordering of the Realme in the ſaid ſeuenteene moneths ſpace. Firſt they rauiſhed the King out of the handes of the Eſtates of the Realme and officers of the crowne, conueying him euen at the houre of his fathers death into the Louure, with his brethren, mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and wife. There they ſo warely watched him and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently kept him, that no man might come neere him, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe ſome of the Guiſia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s were at ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d. At the ſame time alſo began they to be called the Kings kepers. They driue away the Conſtable and others, they ſend away the Princes of the blood, one to carie the order into Spayne, an other to conduct the lady Elizabeth, another to confirme the peace in Flanders: and finally vſed them, as we ſhal ſee comming to ſpeake of their dealings toward ſundry Princes of the blood. They take or rather wreſte from them the dealings in the affaires of eſtate: for when the Parliaments had ſent their deputes to the King, he gaue them to vnderſtand that his two vncles, the Cardinall of Lorraine and the Duke of Guiſe had the whole dealinges: commanding that thence forth all men ſhould reſorte vnto them in all matters tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the eſtate of him and his Realmes and dominions, charging all men to obey them as him ſelfe. Here you ſee them by their owne inſtrument declared Kings: for this yong Prince being of no experience, and miſerable in that he was lincked in to ſuch companie, ſaid and did nothing but what they luſted: becauſe the Cardinal had ſo enured him to his ſignes, that at the leaſt motion of his counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, the King ſpake, walked or helde his peace, &amp;c. In ſo much that he was alſo termed the Kings life or ſoule, for, to ſay the truth, he cauſed the King to moue or ſtand ſtill, yea to counterfaite what cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tenance ſo euer he thought good.</p>
            <p>Hauing ſcatered the princes and lordes whom they ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected, let vs behold how they dealt with the reſt. As tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the priuy council, after they had once aſſured them ſelues of the Chanceler Oliuer whom they reuoked, who alſo ſo farre forgot God and him ſelfe, that he gaue them
<pb facs="tcp:16276:35"/>
his conſcience, they brought thereinto whomſoeuer them ſelues repoſed any confidence in. After the time of Henry, the Parliaments conſiſted of ſuch men as had brought in moſt money, and the chiefeſt fauour of mighty men. The Guiſians conſidering that they ſtood in need of ſuch men, had brought in by litle and litle the children of the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt vſurers and extortioners, with ſuch other maner of people, who haue corrupted all diuine &amp; humane equitie, and retailed ſuch offices as they bought by great, or had in reco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pence of ſome bribes, reueiled contrary to their othe the ſecretes of the Courte, and finally violated iuſtice in all ſortes: ſo that it was an eaſie matter for the Guiſians to order theſe courtes at their owne deuotions, bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling ſome, and repleniſhing other ſome with vaine hope. That which touching theſe matters they had practiſed in the time of Henry, they did now vnder Francis the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conde more hotely proceede in, in ſo much that ſince they haue had great ſupporte on that ſide. They began al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo to order the eſtates of the Kings houſhold, vſurping therein the office of the Conſtable as then great Maſter ſtill. To the ende to bring in their owne ſeruantes, and men of their owne conditions, they diſplaced parte of the late Kings officers, who before had ſtill continued from the father to the ſonne, whom they leaſt vnder pretence of good husbandrie: others they diſmiſſed giuing them halfe paye in the name of penſions, notwithſtanding the new eſtate of houſhold officers did farre ſurmount the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. The prouinces of the Realme and frontier townes, were furniſhed with their ſuppoſts, and ſuch as liked them not were ſente home to their dwelling places: All gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours, heades and captaines of warres and townes, were commaunded to obey the Duke of Guiſe, as the Kinges owne perſon. The reuenues were put into the handes of ſuch as the Cardinal moſt fauoured, and all the courtes of Parliament were admoniſhed, that he had the ſuperinten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence ouer all matters of eſtate. To the ende them ſelues only may remaine armed, they forbid the wearing of all
<pb facs="tcp:16276:35"/>
armes, eſpecially of dagges and fyer woods, alſo of long clokes and great hoſen. For the Cardinal being of a cowar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dly nature, was warned by a Necromantian at Rome, that he ſhould be ſlaine with ſome fyer ſtaffe through the enuy of ſuch enemies as he ſhould procure in France, when he were at his higheſt degree of honour.</p>
            <p>Their firſt tyrannous practiſe was in perſecuting the Proteſtantes in the perſons of certaine counſaylers of the Parliament of Paris, eſpecially Anna du Bourg, whoſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces is amply deſcribed in ſundry treatiſes and diſcourſes, eſpecially in the hiſtory of Francis the ſecond lately ſet forth, which reueileth ſundry villainous iniuſtices and wickedneſſe, committed by certain iudges whom the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal had appoſed and ſuborned.</p>
            <p>An other practiſe was in raiſing the commons againſt the Nobility in maner following. For to ſuppreſſe ſuch as might contrary them, alſo to obteine the goodwill of the commons, and to make their gouernement agreable vnto them, they publiſhed letters of reuocation of all aliena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, as wel for life as yeres, whether they were in recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence for ſeruice or otherwiſe, except ſales, the coyne whereof had bene beſtowed vpon the Kinges great and weighty affaires, without any colluſion, togither with the appanage of the daughters of France, and the dowry of the late Queene Eleonor, which the infante of Portugal did poſſeſſe, all the reſt were thereby reunited vnto the Kings demaines and ordinary receyts. This was the way to bring the mighty into their handes, and procure them ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues more ſeruants then before, by obteining for them ſuch declaratory letters as them ſelues liſted.</p>
            <p>The third practiſe was by driuing away the King of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uarre the firſt prince of the blood, through the moſt vnwor<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>thy meanes that might be, which alſo ſhall be mentioned in the treatiſe of their dealings againſt y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> princes of the bloud.</p>
            <p>By the fourth they wreſted from the Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſtable the office of great Maſter, for the Duke of Guiſe, &amp; bought the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhall Briſſac with the gouernment of Picardie, which they
<pb facs="tcp:16276:36"/>
plucked out of the handes of the Admiral of Chaſtillon.</p>
            <p>In the fifth, to the ende to fortifie them ſelues againſt the preparatiues framed for the repreſſing of their tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, they made eighteene knights of the order at one clap, making of a marke of knighthood, throughly tryed and vnblameable, a collar vnto all kinde of beaſtes.</p>
            <p>For the ſixt, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſidering y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> al this was not ſufficient, but that with the time it was to be feared, leſt y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> eſtats would chale<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge their auncie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t priuiledges &amp; liberty, by meanes wherof their licentiouſnes would lye on long, firſt they cauſed the King wo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>derfully to miſlike of the voice that wente, that the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple was determined in the Kings minority to demande the eſtates: &amp; this brought they very ſubtilly to paſſe through diuers ſleights, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> principall wherof was to bring the migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tieſt into feare through ſome notable meanes, &amp; ſo to winne the Queene mother, that ſhe might be the inſtrument to ſtrike this ſtroke. They therfore propounded vnto this wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, who otherwiſe was ſufficiently pinched with the bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning yrons of her owne ambition, that if the eſtates ſhould take place, as the enemies of her auctority wiſhed, ſhe ſhold be ſent to dreſſe &amp; trimme her garde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, or els co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ueyed ouer the mountes: &amp; therefore, that as her faithfull ſerua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts, they counſayled her to loke to it. Now they regarded not her ſo much, for in caſe King Francis had ouerliued the King of Nauarre, &amp; Prince of Conde, whom they were determined to put to death a litle before that the eſtates were houlden at Orleans, they would ſone haue made her to haue ſcud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, for they marueilouſly ſuſpected her minde &amp; nature: it was therfore their owne commodity wherat they leueled. But this woman feining not to perceiue their ſubtilties, told them that ſhe beleued their words, &amp; ſtil the more &amp; more to eſtabliſh her ſelf, &amp; play them ſome fine pra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cke, ſhe writ to her ſonne in law the King of Spayne, complaining vpon the King of Nauarre &amp; the princes, as if they had ſought (by meanes of the eſtates) to reduce her vnto the eſtate of a handmayd Sone after returned the pacquet out of Spaine, wherein King Philippe writ how he was certified that cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
<pb facs="tcp:16276:36"/>
ſeditious perſons &amp; rebels, endeuored to moue ſome troubles, ſeeking to alter the regiment of the kingdome ſo wiſely already eſtabliſhed by ſo many counſelers, &amp; by the late King Henry his good brother &amp; father in law, as if the King his brother in law were not of him ſelf capable to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſter it, or to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mit it vnto ſuch as he thought good w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the intermedling of any other conſent, or receiuing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny lawe at his ſubiects hands, which he ought not to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit: wherefore for his part he woulde willingly employ his whole power in the maintenance of the authoritie of him and his miniſters, although it ſhould coſt both the life of him ſelfe, and of fourty thouſand men whome he had in a readineſſe, if any man ſhould attempt the contrary: for, ſaid he, he bare him ſo great good wil, that he woulde de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare him ſelfe the tutor and protectour both of him and his kingdome, and alſo of his affaires, the which were to him in no leſſe recommendation then his owne. Thus may you ſee how the heredital enemie of the crowne of Fra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce was called to the defence of their tirannye. Many accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted theſe letters ful of wonderful preſumptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that a forein prince durſt thus openly in the preſence of the whole pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uie counſel (for theſe letters were read among them al e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen before the King of Nauarres face) aboliſh the french liberty, and ouerthrowe the auctoritie of the eſtates. But the Guiſians had already aduertiſed him in what eſtate all thinges ſtood, and in caſe matters had ſo fallen out as they began to doe, he had had his ſhare among them. So at the ſame inſtant, theſe the ſpaniardes letters were as effectual as they deſired, for preſently the King of Nauarre began to cappe them, and of his owne accorde to ſeke al occaſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s wherby to returne to the defence &amp; cuſtodie of his cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>try. howbeit the better to walk him, he together with the Car<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dinal of Bourbo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp; the Prince of la Roch Suryon who were ioined in his commiſſion, were appointed to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>duct y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Lady Elizabeth the kings ſiſter who was maried to the ſpaniard, &amp; her at y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> frontiers both of Fra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce &amp; Spaine to deliuer vp.</p>
            <p>Now therefore peceiuing that the more they ſought the

haſtening of the ouerthrowe of France, the more they opened the mouthes of al true Frenchmen, they determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to fortifie them ſelues by alluring the Parliaments, the Clergie and the men of warre to their partes. The Cardinal ſuppoſed the aduancement of religion, and mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplication of the profeſſors thereof, to be to him a good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly pretence wherewith to intice the Clergie: As for the Parliaments, in as much as manie of the counſaylers and preſidents placed in the ſame, came in at the windowes, and were men but of ſmal conſciences, they needed no great labour to haſten them forward to the aſſubiecting of them ſelues to the houſe of Guiſe, for ſuch good men as remained, being terrified with the examgles of Anna du Bourg and others, laid their handes vpon their mouthes. Alſo the men of warre ſeing the Princes holde their pea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and perceiuing the Duke of Guiſe in his armour, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſt others both high and lowe were in their ſhirtes, way<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting euerie houre for to be ſlaine, toke part with the migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tieſt. And notwithſtanding al men, one and other, were aſſured by ſufficient coniectures, that the drift whereunto the houſe of Guiſe aſpired, was farre other then they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented: yet they being watered with a certaine vaine hope, alſo to the end to maintaine the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſelues in their ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined proſperitie, as men vtterly deuoid of vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding, did wholy caſt them ſelues headlong into this goulfe.</p>
            <p>The Guiſians being thus in fauour, and hauing expul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed al ſuch as were not of their bande, did determine better to looke to their matters vpon this occaſion. As King Francis grew, ſo did he more and more reueile an aſſured iudgement of his euil health. Now had they married him to their niece the Queene of Scots, and had betimes procured him to taſte all worldly delites, and bewrapped in his wifes ſwathing cloutes, to the end to yealde him the more ſupple and delicate to their hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling: But this Prince being ſickely, who alſo in his youth had foreſhewed a moſt dangerous euil diſpoſition, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon he could neither hoake nor ſpit forth, cauſed that cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
<pb facs="tcp:16276:37"/>
his phyſitions of the creation of the Guiſians, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretely warned them to prouide for their owne eſtates, for as much as the King was no man of long continuance. Vpon this report, the Cardinal hauing alreadie moſt men bound to his hand, to the end to finde out their affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons towarde the King, woulde ſometime bewayle the miſerie of the preſent time, alſo the Kinges vnweldines, who ſhoulde not peraduenture haue leyſure, ſaid he, to puniſh the heritikes, ſo that al thinges might after his death happilie be turned otherwiſe. Hauing then ſtrooke this ſtroke, and finding that manie did euen halfe wiſhe that he would inuent ſome ſtedfaſt meanes, proceeded on inferring vpon the Kings ſickneſſe, whome malitiouſly he after a maner taxed of leproſie, and that in double conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration: Firſt to bring the Frenchmen out of taſte in their natural loue which they beare to their Kings, becauſe the King was (as they made men to beleeue) infected with ſuch a contagious diſeaſe, and ſo to prepare them againſt a new change: and next to bring the proteſtants into ſuch hatred (whome he pretended to make authours of this bruite) with the King, that through his comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement they might be vtterly extermined, to the end that they being thus made away, the Guiſians might finde no man to withſtand them. Following this deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination, they bruited abroade through their partakers, that the King went to Bloys to take phyſicke for the ſpottes in his face, and when anie man asked the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of ſuch ſpeach, theſe ſpies woulde cloſely whiſper them in the eares, ſaying, that aſſuredly King Francis was infected with leproſie, and that to the end to procure his health, he muſt neceſſarilie be bathed in the blood of manie yong children: alſo that there was alreadie a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion giuen forth for the taking vp of the moſt beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and healthfull from foure yeres olde vnto ſixe. To be briefe, theſe ruffians which followed the Court, being hired by the Cardinal, went abroade into the boroughes, townes, and villages along the riuer of Loyre enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
<pb facs="tcp:16276:38"/>
of the number of children, being preſently followed by an other number, who inquired whether anie had bene there to take a regiſter of their ſaid children, willing them to take heede how they did deliuer them, becauſe it was to the end to bathe the King in their blood. Theſe voices mightily terrified al the countrey about Loyre, and the King after his comming to Bloys heard therof alſo, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at both he and his mother were greatly moued. But the Cardinal caſt al the fault vpon the Proteſtants, ſo perſua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the King, that he kindeled in him ſuch a hatred as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained printed in his heart vnto his liues end. Howbeit one of theſe villaines who had ſpred theſe newes, and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der colour of warning the parents had gathered great ſtore of money, being taken nere vnto Loches, and found guiltie; and ſo finally condemned to be beheaded, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed, maintained and affirmed euen vntil his laſt gaſpe, that the Cardinal had cauſed to giue this commiſſion both to him and manie others. Al which notwithſtanding, they bent againſt the Proteſtants, and although that a moneth or fiue weekes before they had publiſhed a ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient rigorous Edict againſt the ſaid Proteſtants, yet did the Cardinal now ſet on a freſh onſet of three Edictes in Nouember, 1559. In one of the which theſe wordes were expreſſed. That in the aſſemblies both by day and night of the Proteſtants, not only the vſe of the Romiſh church was villanouſly prophaned, but alſo that ther were ſundrie vile wordes, both infamous, and reprochful againſt the King, and ſuch as in deede tended only to the encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raging of the commons to ſedition, were there alſo diſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed and ſpred abroade. But al this ſerued onely to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoke ſundrie perſons, yea, ſuch as were indeede enemies to the religion, and to moue them to ſuſpect that there was other matter then religion, which in this point, as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo in manie others, ſerued but for a ſhadow. In the meane time the Guiſians raiſed ſuch a blotte vpon their nephue, that although he were no leper, yet after thoſe reportes he loſt moſt part of his reputation.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:16276:38"/>Hereupon alſo aroſe two new accidents, which brought the Cardinal againe out of temper: the one was becauſe the preſident Minard one of his ſlaues of the Parliament of Paris, was ſlaine with a dagge by vnknowen perſons: another was that one of his good ſeruants named Iulian Ferme, was alſo killed neere vnto Chambourg where the King was. This Ferme was departed to carie manie re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrances to Paris, concerning the making of the proceſſes of diuers of the greateſt Princes and Lords of the realme, togither with manie notable perſons, fauou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers of the religion. The Cardinal therefore taking his aduantage of theſe occaſions, gaue a new onſet with this ſlaunder aforeſaid vpon the Proteſtants, and by letters patents forbiddeth the bearing of armes more ſtraightly then before, through ſuch reportes bringing the King into the hatred of the people, which neuer was wonte ſo to be ſuſpected. During theſe affaires, namely the three and twentieth day of December, the Counſailer du Bourg was put to death, togither with ſundrie other Proteſtants in diuers places, to the great diſpleaſure and griefe not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie of ſundrie Frenchmen, but alſo of manie forraine Princes.</p>
            <p>Howbeit al this is nothing in reſpect of ſuch confuſions and miſhappes, as the Guiſians did afterward entangle the King and his dominions in. For their dealings open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly importing tyrannie, their vſual threates againſt the mightieſt in the realme, their ſetting backe of the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and great Lords, their deſpiſing of the eſtates of the realme, their corrupting of the chiefeſt of the iuſtices, who were reduced to the deuotion of theſe new gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours, the reuenues of the kingdome at their comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement deuided, and giuen where they pleaſed, as like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe were al offices and benefices, and to be briefe, their violent regiment being of it ſelfe vnlawful, had altogether prouoked &amp; moued ſuch hatred againſt the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> both of great and ſmal, that thereof proceeded the enterpriſe wherof la Renaudier was captain in the name, &amp; vnder the aduow of
<pb facs="tcp:16276:39"/>
the ſecond Prince of the blood, the handling &amp; breaking whereof we wil more largely declare in the title of their behauiours to the nobilitie.</p>
            <p>At this preſent let vs marke how at that time they moc<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ked the king and his eſtate.<note place="margin">Of the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpriſe of Amboyſe.</note> A certaine aduocate of Paris named des Auenelles, had warned them that there were certaine practiſes in hand againſt them, wherevpon they vſed the helpe of the Queene mother in calling the lords of Chaſtillon to the court, where by their aduice they fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med a new edict in the Kings name, in the which they qua<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lified the rigours of ſuch as before ſtoode in force againſt the proteſtants. This did they only to the end to breake of the ſaid enterpriſe, minding incontinently after to reuoke the ſame, as by particular letters they certified their bond ſlaues of tne Parliament of Paris, whereas this edict was immediatly publiſhed, and the qualifications inregiſtred in the ſecret regiſter, in ſuch wiſe neuertheles that ſome counſelers ſo farre forgat themſelues, as to ſay that it was but a falſe trap to catch the proteſtants in. This was their dalying with the Kings faith, bringing vpon our Kinges an infamous blot &amp; blemiſh, namely to be periurers and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faithful. In the meane time hauing freſh aduertiſements, in<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſtead of thinking vpon their regime<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, or effectually decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring that they ment not to be ſuch me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as hitherto they had bene reported, either that they ſought to treade downe the Kings authority, they now gathered power on al ſides, gaue money out of the Kings coffers to Auenelles and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſpies, ſent men of warre euery way, and kept the king in the middeſt of them ſelues, procuring, during theſe broyles, certaine letters whereby the Duke of Guiſe was made lieutenant general for the King with al abſolute au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie: then was there no talke but of putting al to fire and ſworde, and ſlaying of infinite noble men and gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and ſo blemiſhing the name, honour, ſight &amp; reigne of this yong King, with the moſt horrible cruelties that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer were knowe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. for the firmament, earth &amp; ſea ſhalbe wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes of the barbarouſnes of theſe monſters, who haue
<pb facs="tcp:16276:39"/>
repleniſhed al France with blood, the heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s with witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes and iudges, and the earth with complaintes. Their tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chery appeared in that they would neuer permit the King to heare (as he ought to haue done) the iuſt complaints of his ſubiects, whom they ſo villanouſly entreated before his eies. He oft demanded euen with teares what he had done againſt his people, why they ſhould be ſo moued againſt him (for theſe Lords ſtil blew in his eares that they ſought to ſlaye him, and vnder pretence thereof, had enuironed him with troupes of armed men, gathered from among the worſte members of the whole realme, whome ſince they haue continewed to the end to keepe themſelues about our Kings, whoſe dignitie they haue thereby conuerted in to I wot not what kinde of Perſian pompe, or Turkiſh ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour) and ſaid that he would gladly here their complaintes &amp; reaſons. yea ſometimes he would ſay to his good vncles: I wot not what theſe commotions meane: I heare ſay that you be they who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the people is offended withal: I would to God you would for a while depart, to the end we might be the better certified whether this people be grieued at you or me. But as the murderer that helde his enemies father in his armes did by that meanes ſaue his owne life, ſo the Guiſians ioyning them ſelues (as the yuie about the pyra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mide) cloſe to the yong Kings ſides, did conningly warde theſe blowes, wherewith vndoubtedly they ſhould haue bene pearced through. They did therefore reiect al theſe the Kings wordes, aſſuring him that neither he nor my Lords his brethren ſhould remaine one houre after their departure, becauſe (ſay they) the houſe of Burbon through the ſupport of the heretikes ſought vtterly to root out him and his. Thus may you ſee how they enuenimed the King againſt his blood and people, naming to him Valois in ſteade of Guiſe, openly playing at King put of thy coate, &amp; yet could not their cruelties ſtop men from caſting theſe things in their teeth both in worde and writing, being ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed of weakening, deuouring and waſting both the King and his Realme. But al this ſhal more particularly be deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribed.
<pb facs="tcp:16276:40"/>
The Cardinal was then ſo malepart as in the Kings preſence to ſweare by Gods blood, that the Baron of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtelnaul ſhould die for it, and that no man ſhould ſaue him. In the meane time the Kings edicts poſted euery way, and the Duke of Guiſe the more to floute the King, and doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting leſt the executio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of ſo many might procure him more hatred among al men, fearing alſo leaſt this worde, eſtates, which already began to tingle in their eares, ſhould tickle the peoples hearts, thought it beſt to ſaue the liues (after the maner of a thiefe which holdeth a man in his mercy at the corner of a wood) of the moſt part of the poore ſouldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers who were come on foote: which was done, giuing e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery man cloſely a teſtorne.</p>
            <p>I wil not here ſay that they counſeled the King to ſlaye the Prince of Conde, neither ſpeake of the meanes which they vſed in waſhing and clenſing them ſelues in innocent blood, neither of the ſlanders which they layed vpon the dead perſons, or of their faire promiſes for time to come, and al in the Kings name, and yet obſerued nothing: for we ſhal haue time enough to ſpeake thereof more largely hereafter. But I wil ſet before the readers an other won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful iniury, which their ambition wrought againſt the King and his eſtate.</p>

For by this goodly exploit, the Engliſh Catholikes ſhould haue a ſufficient gage of their reſt for time to come: alſo that it was neceſſary that one of the ſix brethren ſhoulde remaine ſtil in Scotland. During theſe practiſes, there a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſe ſome trouble in Scotland about religion, King Henry the ſecond died, and they ſeeing themſelues on horsback, determined to purſue this pray with horne and crye.

prieſts, the Cardinalty and the Papalty, al which, had it not bene for the fooliſh ambition of the Guiſians, might well haue remained. Alſo beſides this blowe they ſuſteined an other onſet on the coaſte of England, for Queene Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth made a large proteſtation expreſſely againſt them, therein ſetting before al mens ſight the cauſes of theſe broyles, to the Kings confuſion and the deſtruction of his realme.

againſt the Spaniard: for it was incredible what exactions and debtes they procured, alſo what goods them ſelues hoarded vp, during the raigne of their ſaid nephue Fra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cis the ſecond. Theſe behauiours together with extreeme violence vſed, brought moſt part of the commons in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner into deſpaire of euer ſeeing France againe in quiet eſtate, conſidering what blowes theſe men ſtrooke. To procure therefore ſome remedie, they firſt ſent vnder the name of Theophilus, an admonition vnto the Queene mother, wherein the tyrannie of the Guiſians was moſt liuely ſet forth, the concluſion whereof was, that it was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarie to prouide for the gouernme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of the eſtate. alſo to counſel the King according to the auncient conſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and cuſtomes of France, and not after the appetite of the Guiſians. Alſo that the troubles for Religion were to be appeaſed by a holie and free Council. The Queene mother being then in their clawes, and ſeeking by all meanes to pleaſe them, ſerued their turne in ſteade of a ſpie in al maner poſſible, and cauſed the bringer of this admonition to be ſtayed, and afterward hauing ſought in al places for this Theophilus, and put the bringer in feare, euen of beating, conſidering that ſuch writings might in time quench their fires, and turne the edge of their ſwords pointes, they concluded to plant the Spaniſh inquiſition in France, hauing firſt by ſecrete ſeruants, mainteined at the Kings charges, as wel in Germanie as other where, to their powers defamed with al kinde of ſlanders the ſaid Proteſtants. Howbeit the wiſdome of the Chanceler de l'Hoſpital, who politikely ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dled theſe thornes, after a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner brake this blowe: For in place of the Spaniſh inquiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion they framed the Edict called of Romorantin, which forbad al vnlawful aſſemblies, comprehending vnder that title al preachings and exerciſes of Religion. But in ſteade of appeaſing the troubles, this Edict doubled them in all places. The thing which moſt beganne to quicken their ſpirites, was a booke intituled the Kings Maioritie, written in the fauour of the Guiſians by Iohn du Tillet a clarke of
<pb facs="tcp:16276:42"/>
the court of Parliament of Paris, notwithſtanding his en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment at the Cardinals hands, ſhould neuer haue procured his appetite thereunto, but in thoſe dayes all men worſhipped theſe our Lords, who in deed were euen as Kings.</p>
            <p>To this booke was made a quicke and liuely anſwere, which afterward was followed by a number of other ſmal pamphlets, for the which there was great ſerch made, yea, ſuch as to cauſe to hang Martin l'Hommet, who had prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted one, called The Tygre of France, wherein the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal among his other brethren was painted out in al his colours. On the one ſide, the Cardinal fained a kind of ioy that he was thus made immortal, and on the other ſide, he practiſed men to anſwere theſe libels, which diſcouered his ſleights, and alreadie made his Legend, immortalizing in deede the filthineſſe both of him, and of his whole fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie. But among other, Du Tillet, who had receiued a ſhrewd yerke, excuſed him ſelfe for euer after, and exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the Cardinal to prouide for his affaires by ſome other means, namely, by vſing againſt both the perſons &amp; goods of the Proteſtantes, al kinde of rigours which he coulde deuiſe, to the end they might take no ſure footing, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther haue their mindes at libertie: ſhewing him that he might particularly write vnto the Princes, whoſe coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſayle the Cardinal immediatly followed as the moſt expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient.</p>

Moreouer, beſides theſe they had in the courtes of theſe foreine Princes, and of the Princes &amp; Lords of France alſo, other ſecret ſeruants, to whome they gaue ſuch penſions, that the onely expen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of ſecret ſeruants in France, amounted to aboue twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie thouſand franckes by moneth. They had alſo ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
<pb facs="tcp:16276:42"/>
poſtes, who ranne ſpying in the ynnes abroade in the countries, to marke the behauiours of all men, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by ſundrie not thinking thereupon, were ſhortly after im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſoned, and brought to that point that they were no more heard of.</p>
            <p>Theſe thinges thus eſtabliſhed, they renewed their league with the Queene mother, wrote vnto al their par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers, and gathered vp ſo manie men as they could, in ſo much that the Duke of Guiſe durſt make his vaunt, that he had the promiſes of twelue hundred french gentlemen of name, and the oathes of the captaines, with whom, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the olde bands come out of Piedmont, and others whome he had at commandement, he would ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runne al his enemies. The Cardinal alſo propounded vnto the Kings councill, that it were good to ſeaſe vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Prince of Condes perſon, who was burdened to be the chiefe captaine of the enterpriſe of Amboiſe: and hearing that he was gone into Bearn, they perſuaded the King that it was to the ende to arreare new warre againſt him, and ſo to eſcape puniſhment for his former offence. This entrie beinge made, they diſpatched out new com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſions for the rayſing of men, to the ende to aſſayle the King of Nauarre, who had withdrawen the Prince, his brother. They ſent alſo the Marſhal of Saint Andrewes to eſpie the Princes demeanour. They fetched through the meanes of the Queene mother, one named la Plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che, to the end by him more particularly to heare the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>playntes of the Huguenots of eſtate and Religion, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they might with new ſubtilties arme themſelues there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>againſt. Alſo from that time forwarde they were ſo im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudent, and ſhe alſo, if I be not deceiued, as to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme, that the meanes to remedie ſo manie diſconten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, was by cauſing to march alwayes a Prince of the blood, and then one of the houſe of Guiſe, a Prince and a Guiſian, and ſo forwarde. Wherein they ſufficiently diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered what mind led them. The<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they changed the gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours as they thought beſt, they ſent la Motte Go<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>drin into

Dauphine, and others of their own ſtampe here and there, after this maner laying their nets, the more eaſely to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangle their enemies.</p>
            <p>And as Gods iudgements in this one poynt are admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, namely that the ſtouteſt contemners of his maieſty haue for a while all things ſucceeding according to their deſires, to the end their fall afterward may be the greater: ſo happened it to the Guiſians. For lying in watch, and not knowing at which end to beginne, la Sague a Biſcain gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman being ſent from the prince of Conde to ſollicite his friends, was taken at Fountainbleau with ſundry in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions, by meanes whereof together with his owne confeſſions vpon the racke, they did more euidently then before, perceiue the ſtring of their tyrannie to be in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner cut a ſunder, vnleſſe they tooke the better heede. Firſt therefore they impriſoned le Vidame de Chartres and the Prince of Condyes mother in lawe: then ſent they the Countie Ringraue vnto the frontiers of Lorraine, there to keepe in a readines a regiment of Lanſquenets and two thouſand harquebuziers. They cauſe the olde bands co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men out of Piedmont, to deſcend along the riuer of Loyre into Dauphine, faining that they would ſend them into Scotland: but they ſoiourned in Gyen and about Mou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gis, there at their need to aſſure the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues of the Admirals houſes. There did they commit infinite miſchiefs, and yet eſcaped puniſhment, to the ende afterward they might do the better ſeruice, ſpoyling or ranſoming the beſt hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, violating the faireſt virgins and women, and to the end to ſuffer no iuſtice, it was ſufficient to accuſe the plaintifs to be Huguenots.</p>

The Queene mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſeeing ſo many preparatiues, alſo that among al theſe tempeſtes ſhe coulde not eaſely continew, for that one of the parties would humble her, for ſhe more feared the Gui<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſians a hundred folde then any others, accompting her ſelf certaine, (as indede it was true) that if they ouercame the
<pb facs="tcp:16276:43"/>
Princes of the blood, they would neither ſpare her chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren nor her ſelf: &amp; on the other ſide if the Guiſians were mated, in that ſhe was confederate with them, ſhe was alſo in danger to fall with them: ſhe therefore asked the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel of the Admiral and of the Chaunceler, who ſhewed her that it was neceſſary to propound vnto the Kings council, that the princes, lordes of the realme, knights of the order and all other men of authoritie, ought to be aſſembled together for to finde meanes howe to pacifye theſe trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles.</p>
            <p>The Guiſians therfore vnderſtanding this opinion, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding they miſliked vtterly this libertie in the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miral &amp; chanceler, &amp; were fully reſolued to pul them both down together w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the reſt, yet did they herunto condeſce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, acco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pting this the beſt motion of al for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> attaining to their poinct: for ſaid they ſo ſoone as the King of Nauarre, the Prince of Conde, the Conſtable and the reſt ſhal receiue the Kings letters tending to that purpoſe, they would not faile to come, and ſo ſhoulde they all be brought where they ſhoulde be detained, without cauſing them ſo muche paine as to goe ſo farre for them. Againe, notwithſtanding they coulde not obteine this, yet at the leaſte they ſhoulde haue ſo manie voyces in this aſſemblye, that all their deedes paſſed ſhoulde be auctorized, and their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree eſtabliſhed for the time to come, ſo that hereafter it ſhoulde be a manifeſt offence for any man to ſeeke to contrarie them, and ſo conſequently ſhoulde in effecte remayne Kinges of France, attending vntill their other driftes might procure them ſo to be in name alſo. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer if their enemies woulde not come to the ſaid aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblye, then ſhoulde they haue newe matter againſt them, aſwell by bringing them more and more into the Kinges hatred and miſtruſte, as alſo by hauing the better pretence to be reuenged of them. Thus therefore there was now no queſtion but of ſending of packets euery way in the Kings name, and of their owne letters to their friends. Then did a great number of Knights of the order,
<pb facs="tcp:16276:44"/>
whom they had lately created, ſtand them in good ſtead, for there were ſo many voyces wonne to the confuſion of the King and his realme.</p>
            <p>But they vſed a wonderful craft toward the King of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uarre. For they cauſed the Queene mother to write vnto him not to faile, but come: but cloſely they cauſed his owne counſelers, namely Deſcars his chamberlaine, Bouchart his chanceler &amp; other their ſpies and ſecret ſeruants who were toward this prince, to wil him not to come to this aſſembly, and by this meanes they gaue ſo ſhrewd a ſpurne at the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate of this realme that it feleth it yet: for this Prince being put in feare, was cauſe that the gouernment remained to theſe Lordes, who afterwarde anewe ſtrengthened them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues.</p>
            <p>In al this aſſembly were but three perſons which pricked them, of whom two eſpecially angred them outright.

Then that the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>plaints of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple ought to be heard and examined in the preſence of the eſtates. Therupo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he diſcourſed very fitly of the euils which troubled the realme, and wherof the Guiſians (not naming them) were cauſe. Theſe euils were the extraordinary ouer chargings, which were ſo growen &amp; multiplied, that the peo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ple were therewith ouerwhelmed, the waſting of the Kings reuenewes, his great debts, the exceſſiue expenſes of the realme, the ignorance of the auditors, the matters of eſtate troubled, the Kings chiefe miniſters burdened with turning al things to their own aduantage, &amp; of reping their priuate commodities out of other mens calamities, the King not o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beyed, the people not heard &amp; the gouernement diſorde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.
<pb facs="tcp:16276:44"/>
Afterwarde he declared the great commodities which the aſſemblie of the eſtates would procure. By them the King ſhould vnderſtand the particular affaires of his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, he ſhould examine the maners of his people, he ſhould know his own part, and might prouide for his owne eſtate: he ſhould become a good ſhepherd, peaceably ſhearing his ſhepe without otherwiſe hurting of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, he ſhould behaue himſelf royally, that is to ſay, courteoſly &amp; holily: he ſhould be happie and obteine the beautiful title of the name of a Father of the people, whereby the memory of King Lewes the twelfe is moſt celebrated, and ſhineth as an example to the poſteritie, more then al the conqueſtes and victories of his predeceſſors. Then that the people would thereby be the more encouraged to the helping of their King. That whatſoeuer is ordeined in ſuch aſſemblyes is very effectual to make the people quicke and ready in al obedience. Alſo that whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſoeuer few folks are called to the making of lawes, the people doe interpret that they were forged according to ſome mens affections, &amp; without examining ſuch reaſons as thoſe who are abſent might haue alleaged in caſe they could haue bene heard. He added that the houſe of France had floriſhed eleue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hundred yeres a row, by conſeruing the authoritie of the eſtates: that the like had happened in the Empire, and in the realmes of Spaine, England, Scotland, Denmark, Suethland, Boheme, Hungarie and euery where els. He afterward anſwered to al the obiections of ſuch as ſought to perſuade men to beleeue, that the aſſemblie of the eſtates was the diminiſhing of the Kinges authoritie, and then did openly taxe the tyrannie of the Guiſians, who therefore did giue him ſo litle thankes, that after they had cauſed him to be threatened, he was finally forced to withdrawe him ſelfe, and then ſeeing in what eſtate matters were, died for ſorowe. His oration is printed and inſerted into the notable Hiſtory of Francis the ſeconde, lately come to light, and therefore we will no longer prolong theſe matters at this preſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t. But that which moſt of all draue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> into a rage, was the Admirals oratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,
<pb facs="tcp:16276:45"/>
which pearced the impoſtume of their tyrannie: for ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king purpoſely of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Kings new gard, he ſhewed that it was euil done of thoſe, who had thus armed their Prince a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt his ſubiects, and ſaid plainely that in caſe the Kings officers feared to be diſpleaſed, they ſhould take away the occaſions, alſo that the diſpleaſure was not againſt the King, (as to what purpoſe ſhould it ſo be, ſeing he was but a childe, who ſtirred not, neither did anie thing without the cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſaile or prompting of his vncles,) but againſt thoſe who had the dealings in the affaires of the kingdome, whereto it was eaſie to prouide, ſo that al might be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed orderly, and according to the lawes of the realme. The reſt of his oration tended to the ſame end as did Marillac. He ſpake ſome thing alſo of Religion. Then did the bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren of Guiſe ſhew that they were Kings: for beſides that al the Knights of the order there preſent durſt not define, but ſaid only that they were of the Cardinals opinion, they bent them ſelues chiefly againſt the Admiral, inſiſting vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the new gard, and briefly ſhewing that their nephue Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis ſerued but as a maske &amp; cloke to their fellonie: Which alſo the letters ſent immediatly after this aſſembly vnto al Bayliefes and Seneſchals, did euidently declare: For the Cardinal had framed them, who promiſed a mightie refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation in the Church, (but thinke with your ſelues how the harlots do vſe to reforme the ſtues) togither with the eſtates, which were ſummoned to the tenth day of Dece<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, in the towne of Meaux, and that in the meane time that al gouernours and lieutenants of the Prouinces (for the moſt part ſeruants and ſlaues of the houſe of Guiſe) ſhould deliberately viſite their townes, to the end particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly to vnderſtand, &amp; to make report vnto him of the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints of the people, that is to ſay, on al ſides practiſe the eſtabliſhment of their tyrannie: Thus did they ſcoffe at the Kings authoritie, making void &amp; fruſtrate this ſo nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble aſſemblie, as by the effects did incontinently appeare.</p>
            <p>They added hereunto an other practiſe of wonderful preſumption againſt the King, which was by rayſing in
<pb facs="tcp:16276:45"/>
armes all the companies of Ordinances, vnder colour that the enterpriſe of Amboyſe was yet not fully quen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched, although in deede to deſtroy the princes of the blood, to depriue the eſtates of libertie, and to make an ende of marring all. Alſo for their better fortification, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding the returne of the French troupes come out of Scotland, by reaſon of a treaty of peace, wherin the King had bene conſtrayned to agree to certaine both diſhono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable and hurtfull articles, through the fooliſh ambition of his vncles, they ioyned them vnto the old bandes of Pied<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont, Metz, and Picardie for their owne garde, beſides twelue hundred others whom they had reſerued, ouer and beſides the departing of the companies placed and ſent into all gouernments. Hauing then thus the ſword in their handes, and being on cocke horſe, they made a diſpatche from the King their nephue vnto the King of Nauarre, whereby the prince of Conde was charged with treaſon: &amp; therefore for his heartes eaſe, the ſaid King deſired the King of Nauarre to ſend him his brother in ſure and ſafe cuſtodie: if not, him ſelfe ſhould be driuen to fetch him, and that with ſuch companie as the force ſhal remaine to him. The King of Nauarre and his brother anſwered ſo wiſely, and with ſuch conſtancie, as the Guiſians did well perceiue that withall their power they could hardly come to an ende: and therefore they determined to vſe the Kinges faith and promiſe, whereby to deceiue theſe Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and to get them into their trappe: and did inconti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently frame another packet, wherein the King ſent worde to the King of Nauarre and the Prince of Conde, that they might ſafely come to him, and returne againe when they liſted, aſſuring them in the worde of a King that nothing ſhould in any wiſe be attempted againſt their perſons, that peaceably he would heare their declarations and iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifications, that they ſhould not come into any priſon, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that any man ſhould make their proces: only he deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red an anſwere of the Princes owne mouth vnto ſuch points as he was charged with all, and which he could
<pb facs="tcp:16276:46"/>
hardly beleue: to be briefe, that they ſhould be receiued according to their eſtates and dignities, yea they ſhould enioye the ranck which vnto them appertained in the dealing in the affayres, to the ende to haue their aduice and counſayle whereby to bring all things into good po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licie and order.

They therefore ſent the Spaniard worde (who for his parte lay alſo in waite, determining if fit opportunitie might ſerue to giue them the ſlippe alſo) that the King of Nauarre, and the Prince of Conde, vnder colour of quare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling at the gouernment, ſought to put the King and his brethren to death, and through the ayde of the Queene of England, of the Proteſtant princes and of the goſpel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling Switzers to bring in their Religion into France, and after the ſame alſo to preſcribe a rule vnto all Chriſtian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome. They vſed other ſlanders enowe, in the end wherof they added, that if it pleaſed the king of Spaine to maintein &amp; fauour them in their gouernment, they would ſtoppe all the harme that was ment to him, &amp; would ſet to their ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds that King He<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>rys promiſes might be acco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pliſhed. Hereunto
<pb facs="tcp:16276:47"/>
they had ſuch anſwer as they requeſted, through the helpe of the Cardinal of Arras, who then thought to haue found a good breach wherby to bring his maſter into France: but had the Guiſians become Kings, he ſhould haue had leſſe entrie then before, and peraduenture haue bene in greater care then before: for ambition neither wil, neither can a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bide a companion. At the ſame inſtant they alſo ſent to the Pope &amp; to the Duke of Sauoye, alſo through the practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of the Colonnel Freulich, who was at their deuotions, they wonne the catholicke Switzers: determining the ſame winter to deſtroy all their enemies in France, and the next ſpring, to goe and aſſayle Geneua, and thence againſt the Germains &amp; Switzers of the Religion. Alſo to the end the Spaniard might not on that ſide be letted by the Turke, who might haue ſet vpon his countries, whiles his chie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt forces were entred into the King of Nauarres domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, they ſent expreſſely to Conſtantinople to him, to accuſe the Princes of the blood of trecherie and treaſon, &amp; of hauing with certaine men of a new Religion (which acknowledged no Magiſtrates or ſuperiorities) conſpired to put the King and his brethren to death: beſeching him whiles they were buſied in repreſſing thoſe mens pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption, not to innouate or enterpriſe any thing on the coſte of Italie or Spayne, and that in conſideration of the auncient alliance, amitye and confederacie which had bene betwene him and the Kings of France. Of him they had ſo good an anſwere, that the Duke of Guiſe ſo farre exceeded his boundes as diuers times to ſay, that whatſoeuer happened, he had rather that the Realme ſhould fall into the Turkes power, and remaine vnder his dominions, then to ſee the Lutherans and heretikes do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine (for ſo he called them) there receiued.</p>
            <p>Here you ſee wonderful preparatiues for the eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of their greatneſſe: for within the Realme they were armed at all aſſayes, and had their enemies in maner at their feete. They had the townes, gouernours, treaſury and people in maner at their commaundement. The aforeſaid
<pb facs="tcp:16276:47"/>
foreine Princes fauoured them, and peraduenture ſhould haue had ſome ſhare in the cake, as the Spanierd chiefly looked for it, hauing ſo eaſely obteyned truce of his great enemie the Turke, to the ende to ſet vpon France, &amp; ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we may here ſee whereunto the cruell ambition of theſe men had brought all thinges, in caſe God at the ſame inſtant had not appeared, ſmiting them ſundrie blowes on the eares, before they coulde bende their gauntlets.</p>
            <p>They had graunted the aſſemblie of the Eſtates,<note place="margin">The Guiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes broken.</note> the more eaſely to diſcouer their enemies, and called the Kings letters patents the mouſetrappes to catch fooles: but that letted not but in the particular eſtates of the prouin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces many things were propounded co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerning reeſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Realme, as well in matters concerning Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, as policie, as at Bloys, at Angiers, and eſpecially at Paris: for notwithſtanding all the greatneſſe wherewith the Guiſians made them ſelues euery where to be feared, yet was it publiſhed openly in the ful Towne houſe (when the Prince of Condies impriſonment was knowen) that they would not permit the blood of France to be troden downe by ſtraungers. Theſe reportes haſtened the prince of Condies proces, whom they purpoſed to put to death about the tenth of December. As for the King of Nauarre, they alſo ſought his death, endeuouring to doe the King their nephue ſo much iniurie, as to make him the hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of his owne blood. And euen as there remayned no more to doe, but to execute this blowe, to the ende after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde to ſtrike infinite others, God ſtrooke Francis the ſeconde with an impoſtume in the eare, which finally ſtifled him, and ſo he dyed the fifth day of December in the yeere 1560. This death ouerthrewe all their enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſes, and did ſo quayle them at the firſt, that when they knew there was no more hope, they went &amp; cloſed vp the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſelues in their lodgings, repleniſhed with miſtruſt and incredible feare, from whence they departed not of a day or twayne, vntyll they were aſſured by the Queene
<pb facs="tcp:16276:48"/>
mother and the King of Nauarre, that they ſhoulde haue nothing done to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. But they were not ſo farre ouerſeene, but that they cauſed preſently at their comming forth, to carie into their lodging three or foure ſcore thouſande frankes, which were left in the coffers: inſomuch that all the Kings treaſures were waſted, but no man withſtoode them, which was thought ſtrange, whereby men might plainely perceyue, that theſe things were not done with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Queene Mothers conſent, who ſought through their authoritie to mainteine hers: and to ſay the trueth, if ſhe had not ſupported them, their noſes had then kiſſed the ground: but the ſleightes and practiſes on that parte do deſerue an other diſcourſe. I had here in maner for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten an other draught of the wickedneſſe of the Guiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans againſt their nephew. For ſeeking to waſhe their own handes of all that was paſte, and the ſame to caſt vpon the Kings power and abſolute will, notwithſtanding he were but a childe, wanting both witte and diſcretion to be able to examine or to enterpriſe ſuch and ſo waightie matters, yet did they eaſely obteine of him, that he ſhoulde ſpeake courteouſly and louingly vnto the King of Nauarre, which he dyd fulfill three dayes before he fell ſicke, declaring that the Guiſians had neuer enterpriſed any thing againſt him or his: but that of his owne mere motion, and contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie to their opinion he had impriſoned his brother the Prince of Conde, and this he deſired him to beleeue, and for the loue of him and of the Queene his mother, to blot out whatſoeuer euill opinion he might haue conceiued a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them. This practiſe ſtoode them in great ſteade af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwarde, for hauing wreſted this confeſſion out of the Kings mouth, whom herein they cauſed villanouſly to lye, they did afterwarde ſtiffe and ſtoutly denie whatſoeuer might be obiected againſt them, laying all vpon the dead mans backe, offering the combate to any that woulde ſaye that euer they of their owne heades had enterpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed any thing at all.</p>
            <p>Beſides all the aforeſayde practiſes with ſtraungers, at
<pb facs="tcp:16276:48"/>
the ende of the Eſtates in the Kinges name, all the power of France ſhoulde haue bene deuided into foure partes, and led by the Marſhalles of Saint Andrewes, of Briſſac, and of Thermes, and by the Lorde of Aumale, to make ſuch hauocke as all the worlde may well thinke. For be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide the vtter ſubuerſion of all Eſtates, and deſtruction of al the mightieſt and moſt auncient houſes which ſhould haue bene aſſaulted, were it for their religion, eyther for hauing taken the Princes parte, either for hauing ſpoken amiſſe of the King, with infinite ſuche other meanes, France ſhould haue bene reduced to the Turkes order of liuing, to the ende afterwarde no man might haue had power to reſiſt or withſtande the tyrannie of the Guiſians. Alſo if through importunitie they chaunced to forgiue any, it ſhould haue bene with the condition of perpetuall ignominie. Moreouer the Cardinall had vſed ſuch dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, that there was no corner in all the Realme, where he had not the names and ſurnames of all the inhabitants, who eyther were Proteſtantes or of any dealing or enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe to be able to hurt him, or that had not ranged them ſelues after his deuotion: and this had he gotten by the meanes of certayne Apoſtataes and ſecret ſeruantes, who ordinarily went ploding about here and there, to the end to ſounde the heartes and willes of men: inſomuch that ſuch truandes were made iudges, and ordered the ſenten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of lyfe and death vnto all the worlde. Now were they determined ſo to haue prouoked the people agaynſt the Proteſtantes eſpecially, that they ſhoulde neede no other hangman: &amp; herein it was to no purpoſe to ſay, I am none, for the Monkes &amp; other preachers hyred to the ſame pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe in going about, ſhould pronou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce the condemnations. The graunting of this libertie to the common people was commonly called as a watch word, The letting looſe of the great Greyhound, and there was no part of France which coulde haue bene exempt from this calamitie. Alſo the King of Spaine was on his parte ſo forwarde, according to his tyme and promiſe made to the Guiſians, that
<pb facs="tcp:16276:49"/>
ſixe thouſand Spanierdes had already taken the way to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Bearn, entending ſodeinly to ſurpriſe the Queene of Nauarre, and both her and her childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to put to death, committing like murther of her ſubiects as of the King of Fra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces: and in ſo doing to ſtay and breake the forces which were in Guyen. But ſo ſoone as the Spanierd had aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſement of the Kings death, alſo that the Queene of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uarre had diſcouered him, and ſo fortified her ſelfe in her ſtrong holdes, that he ſhould hardly without long ſiedge come by her, not knowing what fould the affaires woulde take, doubting alſo to haue thoſe on his backe, who had cauſed his troupes to come into the cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trey, among who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Monluc was one of the firſt, vpon promiſe of the Countie of Arminack: wherefore he retired without dooing any thing, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſidering alſo that ſuch of the Kings letters wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he had graunted the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> paſſage through Bayonne (which is one of the principall fortereſſes &amp; keyes of the realme) whether they were many or few, and his commandement to ayde them with as much victuals, artillery, and muniti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as they would require, would not nowe be of any force or vertue after the ſaid Lordes death, how plaine &amp; full of threates ſo euer the ſame were.</p>

Alſo through their earneſt deſire that their Niece might haue iſſue, and yet knowing King Frauncis but ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply diſpoſed thereunto, in that his generatiue partes were altogither dulled and hindred, they permitted many cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers to haue her companie, who did their endeuours to make her very fruitfull: yet am I aſhamed to know that in a certayne table which an Italian of Laques found meanes

Willingly would I haue forgotten the execrable filthineſſe which I haue hearde reported of him and his brethren, by ſuch as in Francis the ſeconds time followed the Courte, and were witneſſes of ſuch things as appeared almoſt manifeſtly in all mens eyes. Francis had deſpiſed all the world to the end to ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour them, he had diſpleaſed all his Realme to ſatisfie them and to ſet them alofte, he prepared to thruſt the knife into his owne blood (a man may ſaye into his owne bodie) thereby to ſaue them: to be briefe, he had hated him ſelfe to loue them, and abaſed his owne perſon for their exaltation: and yet was there euer perſon dead of the peſtilence, whoſe bodie men did more abandon, then them ſelues did this? Thus it was. The Cuſtome at all tymes in France obſerued after the deceaſſe of the Kings is ſuch, as that they whom in their liues they haue moſt fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoured, and who eſpecially haue had the ordering and dealing in their affayres, ought to accompanie them to their graues, and during the fourtie dayes that they be kept and ſolemnely ſerued, wayte vpon their funeralles: This ceremonie did the Guiſians cauſe to be moſt ſtraight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly obſerued after the death of Henrie, and hereunto the Duke of Guiſe was in double maner holden and bounde, for enioying (togither with the ſoueraigne authoritie) the great Maſterſhip of France, which doe namely binde thoſe that doe enioye ſuch a dignitie: yet all this notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, ſo it was, that none of the houſe of Guiſe did this honour to their King and Maſter the husbande of their Niece, who in his life time was ſo deare to them: but by their counſaile and aduice he was both by day and night ſent to be throwen into his Fathers tombe without any

That which brought the Guiſians and their partakers to this point, was the aſſembly of the eſtates, where they would nedes aſſiſt for feare leſt any thing ſhould be decreed againſt the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, alſo leſt their abſence ſhould bewray to all the world the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence betwene their furious and vnlawful gouernement, &amp; that of the Princes of the blood, of the Conſtable, of his eldeſt ſonne Montmorency &amp; of the brethren of Chaſtil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon: alſo leſt by meanes hereof, the cauſe and roote of the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tagion, which infected the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon wealth ſhould be cut of, which was the thing that they feared more then the plague, for they ſaw that vnleſſe they tooke ſome order, it would be knowen that them ſelues were the very cauſes &amp; originals of diſorder. But which moſt troubled them, they had a woma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to gouerne, whoſe ſtedfaſtnes they did great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſuſpect, by reaſon the Admiral was nere to the yong king her ſonne, to whom ſhe ſeemed to yealde as much as ſhe could paſſe withal, for the mollifying of the Princes and Eſtates. They douted alſo leſt ſo ſoone as their backs were turned to the Courtward, &amp; that they had giuen ouer the dealings in the affaires, there would come in infinite com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints, the verifying wherof neither the Quene mother, neither other their friends could denie, ſeing that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> crime of treaſon walked to faſt abroad. Theſe occaſions therefore cauſed the Guiſians to forſake &amp; ouerthrow al good lawes and vſual orders put in practiſe as funerals.

This writing therfore was interpreted as a lame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> made in the name of King Francis, ſeeing him ſelf forſaken &amp; deſtitute of ſuch a chamberleyn as Tanneguy was: and then ſaying (as if he reuoked) that Ta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>neguyes good nature &amp; dutie was not ſo wonderfull, becauſe he was a French man &amp; no ſtraunger: wherein the Authour ſeemed to note the Duke of Guiſe, becauſe he had wreſted the office of Great Chamberleyn from the houſe of Longueuille.</p>
            <p>Now haue we ſeene the euill entrie of the Guiſians du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the reigne of Francis the firſt,<note place="margin">The Guiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans behaui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours in the time of Charles the ninth.</note> alſo howe in the time of Henrie the ſecond, their ambition repleniſhed al Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manie and Italie with blood, howe their couetouſnes ſet to ſale, as it were to the moſt giuer, the lawes &amp; all iuſtice, howe through infinite exactions it emptied the purſes both of rich and poore, whereof folowed innumerable ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamities. Then howe in the time of Francis the ſeconde, it was to be doubted whether bare greater ſway in them, either rapine or crueltie.

            <p>King Francis being dead, as is aforeſaid, and the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal when he was euen readie to giue vp the Ghoſt, hauing procured him to vtter theſe words: Lorde forgiue me my ſins, &amp; impute not vnto me whatſoeuer my officers in my name and authoritie haue done: The Guiſians minded to followe a new counſayle, which was to put of their lyons ſkinne, that they could no longer keepe without manifeſt daunger of being drawen to flaying, and to put on the foxes cace. Nowe therefore they determined to folowe their hunte through the Queene mothers meanes: They promiſed her that if ſhe will fauour them, they will ſet to their handes to keepe her in the chiefeſt degree. Alſo the more to put this hammer into her head, they doe alleadge vnto her, that the Princes through her wincking at mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters being ſo euill dealt withall, can do no leſſe then wiſhe her harme, ſeeking all meanes to bring her downe, to the ende to ſet vp the Conſtable and the houſe of Chaſtillon, whereby afterward to make more alterations: That the eſtates will diſgrade her, vnleſſe ſhe goeth out at the back doore to meete them: alſo although then the Guiſians were excluded, yet haue they ſo many ſeruants &amp; friends, that for a long whyle they could withſtand the Princes. In the meane time that ſhe ſhould retayne her authoritie, &amp; that when her children ſhould come to age, the gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Princes &amp; their partakers ſhould vaniſh away.
<pb facs="tcp:16276:51"/>
The Queen being as crafty as they, knew how to take hold of this proffer, and ſo to get in betwene both parties, that bending ſometimes one way, ſometimes an other, to this preſent ſhe hath kept the place, to the confuſion of thoſe who had thither lifted her. Hauing thus found ſo good an attourney, who at once reconciled them to the King of Nauarre, and gaue forth ſpeaches that ſhe would main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teine the Guiſians againſt all their enemies and miſre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porters, they beganne ſomewhat to aſſure them ſelues. Now therefore remained no more to doe, but to beate downe firſt the Prince of Conde, who would not be han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dled as his brother the King of Nauarre, then Montmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rency, and then the Chaſtillons. Hereupon came to ſight the goodlyeſt determination for their purpoſe in the worlde. They perceiued the number of Proteſtantes ſtill to increaſe in all partes of France, alſo that the Prince of Conde and the Chaſtillons were openly of that profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, for the Prince had made manifeſt declaration there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, hauing cauſed Genly and others to certifie King Francis that he was ſo in deede. Yea euen in the hardeſt time of his affliction, he draue out of his chamber a prieſt, whom the Guiſians had ſent thither to ſinge Maſſe. As for the Admiral, he had in the full aſſembly at Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainbleau preſented their ſupplication to the King, ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the ende to obteine ſome Churches and publik exerciſe thereof. He had alſo declared to the Queene mother that he would neuer abiure his Religion, but of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fred to diſpute againſt the Cardinal. The lorde d'An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delot had of long time bene of the ſame profeſſion, and it is knowen that at the accuſation of the Duke of Guiſe, and by the ſolliciting of the Cardinal, the late King Henry had almoſt ſlaine him, when on a time he asked him if the Maſſe were good, and that he anſwered that it was a prophane and wicked thing. The Cardinal of Chaſtillon alſo began by litle and litle to forſake the Papaltye.

They concluded therefore a while not to medle with the Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, for (ſaid the Cardinal of Lorraine) as yet there were none but raſcales of that profeſſion, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it were beſt to let ſome great and welthy men alſo enter into it, to the ende by their deſtruction to get ſome thing.</p>
            <p>Now in making warre againſt the Proteſtantes, they ſhotte ſundry wayes with owne ſelfe arrowe: for firſt they obteined the fauour of the Pope, the King of Spayne and others, of whom they looked for ſome helpe.</p>
            <p>Secondly, they were aſſured that ſundry of the beſt townes in the Realme, were ſo deepely rooted in Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perie, that it would be harde to plucke away their olde skinne without good ſtore of ſtripes, alſo that with the leaſt ſtaye in the worlde, they would vſe all reſiſtance poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, they knew the Queene mothers diſeaſe, who woulde hardly permit her children to be brought vp in Religion, for her ſelfe was of none at all: alſo that ſuch countenance as for a while ſhe might ſhewe, ſhoulde be only to the ende to winne the Proteſtantes, and to ſet them againſt the Catholickes, that whiles they were the one ſorte bent againſt the other, her ſelfe might rule all, and ſo that they ſhould haue no leyſure to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider of or examine her actions. They had alſo a number of ſecret ſeruantes, who to the ende to robbe and make hauocke of the Proteſtantes goods, woulde become moſt Catholicke. The courtes of Parliament alſo were ſo com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded, that vnleſſe iuſtice were reformed from the crowne of the head vnto the ſole of the foote, the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtantes ſhould neuer proſper. Againe, hauing through the Queene mothers helpe the King and his brethren in their handes, they might eaſely vnder that ſhield fight againſt all their enemies, and in time order them as they liſted, yea through their ouerthrowe become mightier
<pb facs="tcp:16276:53"/>
then euer before. But yet there was one thing which trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled them, namely the prolonging of time, and the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſtancie of the Queene mother, which the Duke of Guiſe more feared then any other thing, togither with the Prince of Condes liuelineſſe: To remedye therefore all this, they procured (as is afore ſaid) their atonement with the King of Nauarre, which was ſo brought about, that by the ſame meanes he reſigned to the Queene mother in preſence of the Duke of Guiſe, and of the Cardinal of Lorraine, all ſuch right as he might pretende vnto the regencye of the King and the Realme, neuer to quarell, demaunde or accept the ſame againe, and thereof gaue them an acquittance ſealed with his owne hande.</p>
            <p>Hauing thus gotten this poinct, they concluded that if the Prince ſeemed to deale with them, he ſhould haue to doe with ſo ſtrong a match, as that ſoone they ſhould ouercome him: alſo that this might be the meanes to bend his brother againſt him, and ſo they ſhould draw the one party to the Catholickes. As for the Queene, they determined a while to let her paunch ſome times one way, and ſome times another, curiouſly watching to what ende her behauiours would come. Againe, they were well aſſured that hauing this aduantage ouer the King of Nauarre, ſhe would ſo practiſe the eſtates, that her auctority ſhould be allowed of: alſo that them ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues had ſuch parte in her, that her inconſtancie would turne to their commoditie: alſo that before the yere were paſſed, they ſhould ſee ſome ſtirringes, whereby to helpe them ſelues vp againe.</p>
            <p>One parte of that whereof they perceiued ſome likely<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoode, came to paſſe: but in the reſt they were ſhrewdly deceiued. For whiles they ſufficiently tormented the Proteſtantes with foure ciuill warres, &amp; a horrible murder vnder Charles the ninthe, fiue of them came ſhort home, and the moſt doulte of all remained behinde, &amp; as for the moſt apparent of their diſcent, who at this preſent is Duke of Guiſe, he is in ſuch eſtate, as (according to the prouerbe
<pb facs="tcp:16276:54"/>
which runneth of ſuch as are vpon the ſea) A man can not well ſay whether he be aliue or dead: for God hath giuen him ſuch a blow on the face, that he ſhall remaine blaſted for euer. We muſt therefore conſider what hurte they haue done to the King, his Realme, and them ſelues in all theſe ciuill warres: and as the thunderclappes alwayes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their comming doe ſhew by ſome tokens which goe before, their following to be at hande, euen ſo the Gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſians before that they ſhotte their thunderboults into France, gaue forth certaine deafe noyſes, practiſing here and there, whereby to become more furious after that they were once fortified. Being deliuered of that which they moſt feared, which was the reſearche for the Princes impriſonment, through ſuch aſſurance as the Queene mother had rooted in their heartes, alſo being reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to the King of Nauarre, hauing, as is afore ſaid, procured the King lately deceaſed, to declare that he of his owne abſolute auctoritie had cauſed the Prince of Condye to be empriſoned: they determined to goe to the eſtates, there to heare what would be ſaid, and ſo helpe their mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters as much as might be poſſible. But before they goe any further, they enter league with the Cardinals of Tour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non and of Armignac, the Duke of Nemours, the Marſhals of S. Andrewes and of Briſſac, the lordes of Rendan, Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigues, Sipierre, Monluc, la Motte Gondrin, la Suze, Sanſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſac, Sauigny and many other lordes and captaines, who hoped to become mighty, riche and welthy through the ciuill warres, which (ſaid the Guiſians) the Princes would bring in, togither with the alteration of the Principalitie. The voice hereof cauſed they to be ſounded in the King of Nauarres eares, who in ſtead of prouiding according to his duety there againſt, began to faint, and to reſigne all his auctoritie, as anon we will more amplye declare. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of enſued the order the one and twentieth day of Decem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber 1560. eſtabliſhed in the Kings council, touching the gouernement of the eſtates of the Realme: wherein the Queene mother was planted vpright.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:16276:54"/>In the meane time happened a chance very agreable to the Cardinal, but his ioy continewed not. The deputies of about fourty baylywickes and Seneſchaltyes of the realme, alleaged that their auctoritie was out, becauſe King Francis had ſummoned them, &amp; he being now dead, they muſt needes haue new remembrances. The Cardinal &amp; his faction ſuppoſed that although this could not whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſſolue the eſtates, yet would it ſomewhat delay them, whiles in the meane time they might practiſe ſome thing: but through the wiſdome of the Chaunceler and others, it was agreed that they ſhould proceed, ſeeing that the royal dignitie died not but was repreſented in his ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſour. Alſo in caſe theſe declaratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s had delaied the eſtates, then had it gone wrong with the Guiſians, for in their new remembrances they alſo ſhould haue receiued new com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſions. The Queene mother alſo fearing leſt they ſhould ſmel out the writing, which with threats ſhe had wreſted from the King of Nauarre, and thereupon had examined her doings, and corrected her as appertained, for working ſo trecherouſly againſt the peoples libertye, haſted the matter forwarde, whereby the Guiſians gotte moſt.</p>
            <p>They therupon geſſed that which was true, namely that at this aſſembly they would deale in matters as wel of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion as of eſtate: they were alſo aſſured that at that time Religion ſhould be the chiefeſt, which greatly reioyced them: yea they determined with all their might to heaue at that wheele, to the ende the other might remaine vnde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cided, or if neceſſity driue them to giue accompt of their adminiſtratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, they entended to preſent vp their reckoning in a warlike fielde, there to be examined &amp; proued at the ſwordes poinct, wherein they aſſured them ſelues to make ſo fayre a broyle, that their wronges together with the rights of their aduerſe party, ſhould there ſtray away toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. They muſt therefore earneſtly deale in Religion, and with the ſame to cloye the Huguenots, who with earneſt affection, purpoſed no other matters but to thinke vpon the liberty of their conſciences, accompting al bodily bon<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dage
<pb facs="tcp:16276:55"/>
ſomewhat tolerable, ſo that the principal might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine in his ful perfection. But yet they were ſore diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented: for the one could not conſiſt without the other, alſo Godlineſſe without iuſtice in this world hath but a feeble foundation: as there were ſome that ſaid at the ſame time, that if the eſtabliſhment of the realme in her priſtinate glorie, and the reformation of Religion did not both goe together, we ſhoulde yet beholde and finde greater miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefes then before, which experience hath now taught to thoſe who then woulde beleeue nothing, and God grante that the French nation may in time learne.</p>
            <p>This determination being taken, the Cardinal of Lor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raine practiſed al meanes to haue the charge of making the oration in the name of the three eſtates vnto the King, whereunto the Clergie did conſent: and therfore did ſend one named Griueau a Canon of the holy Chappel, vnto the third eſtate for to obteine their graunte, but he had preſently an open anſwere, that they would not accept him to ſpeake for them of whom they minded to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaine: and vpon this occaſion, he refrained from ſpeaking to the nobilite, taking in the meane time ſuch hold of this anſwere, as thereby he might turne it to his owne commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditie: for he aſſured the Catholikes, namely the Clergie, that now the Huguenots would tread them downe, vnleſſe in time they withſtood their determinations, and therfore conſequently they ought in the oration for the clergie, eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially to ſtand vpon that point, for ſeing the third eſtate had ſo detected it ſelfe, and proteſted againſt him who was one of the principal members of the Apoſtolike ſeate, they now would not ſpare the other ſmaler dependances. Hereupon the Clergie choſe for their ſpeaker one named Quintin, a forſaker of the religion, and at that time a doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor of the Canon Lawe at Paris. The nobilitie choſe the Lord of Rochforte, and the third eſtate, Lange an aduo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate of Burdeaux.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:16276:55"/>
came the Cardinals of Lorraine and Guiſe, alſo the Duke of Guiſe, to the end by hearing the oratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, to apply the ſame ſo much as they might to their own co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>modities. The firſt day was ſpent in hearing the Chancelers oratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, which litle or nothing touched them, for he ſpake but ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally. The Deputie of the third eſtate ſtood vpon taxing the ignorance, couetouſnes and diſſolutions of the Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>aſtical perſons, not particularly touching any. Rochfort in the name of the Nobilitye did much commend the deliue<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ry of the gouernment vnto the Queen mother, noted cer<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tain abuſes in the Clergy and Iuſtices, &amp; after that he had deſired the King to maintaine the nobilitie in their priui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges, he offred vp a ſupplication, wherin he deſired ſome churches for the gentlemen proteſtants. Quintin on the clergies behalfe, made a long oration or inuectiue againſt the proteſtants, ioyning againſt the mightieſt, in couert wordes taxing the Admiral, who had preſented the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of them of Normandie which deſired Churches.</p>
            <p>Theſe orations put the Cardinal and his brethren in good hope: for they perſuaded them ſelues that in caſe the eſtate of Religion went forward, as it was very likely, the ſame would be the vndoubted meanes to ſeperate the Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

The deputies who were appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to viſite the roules of the eſtates, hauing made their reporte vnto the priuie councill, the King of Nauarre and the Chanceler to the couent of the Franciſcans, to ſpeake with the eſtates there aſſembled, where they began to talke of the reſtitutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of exceſſiue gifts, of diſcharging the Kings debts and ſuch other like matters: but this could not be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>paſſed before that thoſe who in the time of He<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ry y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d &amp; Fra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cis the ſeco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d had had y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> whole deali<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gs in matters of eſtate &amp; in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> treſury, were reduced into great extremity.
<pb facs="tcp:16276:56"/>
Of this motion was the Queene mother very glad, as one aſſured that by reaſon of her regencie, ſhe ſhould not be moleſted, &amp; therfore determined to heaue at that wheele, thereby to pul downe thoſe whome ſhe accompted to hie next her owne perſon. The King of Nauarre had not med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led at al, but the Guiſians, the Conſtable, and the Marſhal of S. Andrewes were deepeſt in this matter: there was therefore but one onely remedie wherwith to breake this blowe, which was by troubling the whole eſtate of the Realme. For the attaining whereunto, and for the more co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>modious compaſſing of al things hereunto requiſite, in ſteade of proceeding in this point, God who iuſtly was diſpleaſed, minding to begin to ſcourge the French Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, permitted them to remit the eſtates vnto the moneth of May next enſuing: which was the thing that the Gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes eſpecially ſought for, neither was the Conſtable anie whit ſorie, notwithſtanding he had often proteſted that he was readie to giue vp his accomptes.</p>
            <p>The King of Nauarre being yet ſomewhat affected vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Religion, his brother the Prince of Conde, and the Chaſtillons ſought to aduance the ſaid Religion, and that they might the better do, in caſe for a while they deferred dealing in the other point, which ſhortly after they might neuertheleſſe eaſely enough take in hand againe. But they were deceiued through the ambition of the Queene mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the daſtardlineſſe of the King of Nauarre, the practiſes of the Guiſians without the Realme, and the driftes of the Conſtable within the kingdome, whom vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der colour of Religion, they had ſeparated from his ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phues.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:16276:56"/>
ſhe could more eaſily haue delt with them: for ſhe had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>readie in her hands the Chaſtillons. The King of Nauarre ſuffred him ſelf to be led euerie way, and as for the Prince of Conde, in caſe ſhe withſtoode not the amends for ſuch iniuries as he pretended through his impriſonment to haue bene done vnto him, ſhe accompted him as hers, yea ſhe looked to finde in him a new ſtaffe wherewith to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe the Guiſians. The Cardinal of Lorraine vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the Prince to be readie to come to the court, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted from the ſame vnder pretence of reſidence in his Archbiſhoppricke of Reims, leauing behind him his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther as a ſpie, and others to the end to practiſe according as matters might fall out. After that the King had wel receiued the Prince of Condie, and that in ful counſel he had iuſtified him ſelfe, he was permitted to ſue out more ample declarations, &amp; for the ſame purpoſe went to Paris. Soone after this fell an other controuerſie, which much moleſted the Duke of Guiſe and his partakers, yea, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the policie of the Queene mother, who at this time ſtoode them in good ſtead, and ſought in time to come to aide her ſelfe, they had at the ſame inſtant bene quite vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horſed: for the King of Nauarre through the ſolliciting of ſome who ſawe meetly cleare, did complaine to the Queene of the too great authoritie which the Duke of Guiſe tooke vpon him, who at al times had bene her ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſarie: alſo that the ſaid Duke of Guiſe continuing about the King, he could not remaine, and therefo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               </gap> that it was expedient that either the one or the other departed from the Court: after that the Queene had alleaged ſome ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſes tending to the ouerthrowe of this matter, the ſaide controuerſie proceeded ſo farre, as that the next morning the King of Nauarre put on his bootes, and was readie to depart, accompanied with the Princes of the blood, the Conſtable, the Lords of Chaſtillon and manie other great Lords. Now the Queene ſeing that remaining among the Guiſians onely, the world was at an end, both of her ſelfe, and of them alſo: for her owne conſeruation, fained to
<pb facs="tcp:16276:57"/>
procure their co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>moditie, to the end in caſe they yet once againe got the maſterie, they ſhould not harme her. She ſent therefore to fetch the Conſtable, cauſing the King to command him not to depart, by the compaſſing whereof al this matter was broken of, and the King of Nauarre ſent to fetch backe his mulets, which alreadie were gone as farre as Melun.</p>
            <p>This controuerſie being diſperſed, raiſed a voyce that the Queene maintained the Guiſians againſt the Princes of the blood: inſomuch that the particular eſtates of Paris proceded and began to touch the chiefe points of the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate, not forgetting the article of yelding vp the accompts. The Guiſians were expreſſely named, with ful determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to ſeeke al meanes poſſible to forbid them anie entry into the priuie council, before they had giuen vp their a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foreſaid accompts. The Queene mother of the one ſide greatly reioyced in ſeeing the Guiſians her chiefeſt ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies by this meanes in danger. Againe, on the other ſide ſhe was in ſome care as concerning her regencie. To pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uide therefore againſt al inconueniences, ſhe through the aide of the Conſtable made a new agreement with the King of Nauarre, in ſuch wiſe as the ſaid King was pleaſed, and moued the Duke of Guiſe to counterfeit humilitie, which he now more then vſually did put in practiſe. She ſent alſo for the Prince of Conde to come and ſeale to this accorde, &amp; vſed the helpe of the Marſhal of Montmoren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, in amending and correcting al that had bene conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in the particular eſtates of Paris, touching the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernement of the Realme.</p>
            <p>The Cardinal dealt with the Queen mother in al theſe matters, to whom he writ often, and notwithſtanding eche of them miſtruſted other, yet had they ſo long kept houſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holde together, that the taking of this path ſeemed moſt neceſſary for both their conſeruations. And in deede we may wel ſay that al the policies of the Guiſians did neuer ſtand them in ſo good ſtead, as did the only wit of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Queen mother, who neuertheleſſe did mortally hate the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: but this

In the meane time, the Cardinal wayted for the yong King at Reims, who was brought thither to be anointed, wheras the Duke of Guiſe was ſo preſumptuous, as to ſteppe in betwene the King of Nauarre, and the Duke of Montpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſier, ſo to march after the King, and by ſuch ſleyghtes to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come equal vnto the princes of the blood. There the Car<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dinal finding his ſtrength ſufficient, hauing wonne this point, to propound Religion as a cloke to his ambition, did then grieuouſly complayne of the proteſtantes, decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring that during the parly concluded vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> concerning the determination of theſe controuerſies, the King ought not to permit any kinde of innouation, and that for the more aſſured prouiſion thereagainſt, it was requiſite to make an inuiolable law: alſo to the ſame end to aſſemble in the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament of Paris, the Princes, Lords, &amp; others of the Kings priuie counſaile, there to frame an arreſt, which euer after ſhould ſolemnely be obſerued. But al this was no other ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing a newe policie whereby to haſten the practiſes of the houſe of Guiſe. Now the Cardinal knew wel that in this aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bly of the Prelates for the determination of matters of Religion, there would be nothing diſpatched, alſo that while things hung thus in ſuſpenſe, the King ſhould be cal<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>led vpon to permit the excerciſe of the Religion openly: which being once granted, the prince of Condye and the Chaſtillo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s would ſtep in afterward to withſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d him: for the withſtanding wherof, he ſuppoſed y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> in preuenting this par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly through an other aſſemblie at Paris, where he had men enough at commandement, he might get ſomewhat, or at the leaſt ſo bend the one ſort againſt the other, that him ſelfe ſhould loſe nothing. This was the cauſe of the aſſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of that aſſemblye: whereunto the Queene mother agreed almoſt for the ſame conſiderations, and the contra<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ry parties in hope it would redound to the commoditie of the whole realme.

The Spaniarde and diuers Italian Princes were daily aduertiſed of the eſtate of the affaires, and then did the Queene mother ſtand the Guiſians in ſteade of a ſecretarie, to the end to make out goodly diſpatches in the Kings name againſt the Princes of the blood, whome in the meane time they ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med greatly to fauour. For at that time, namely the 13 of Iune 1561. did the Parliament of Paris, al the chambers being aſſembled in their red gownes in the great chamber of pleas, in the preſence of the Duke of Guiſe, the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals of Lorraine and Guiſe with others, pronounce their ſentence concerning the innocencie of the Prince of Conde: alſo about the end of Auguſt following, was the atonement made betwene the ſaid Prince, and the Duke of Guiſe.</p>

Calling alſo to minde, whatſoeuer all auncient hiſtories or recordes as wel holy as prophane, haue left of al antiquitie as teſtimonies of valiant deedes, they do finde that neuer any monarch, King or ſoueraigne Prince hath died indebted in ſuch exceſſiue ſummes as did the late King Henry your Honorable father, how long or continual warres the ſaid Monarches haue ſuſteined or enterpriſed, for the augmenting of the boundes and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mites of their realmes and empires.

For the reparation therefore of ſuch for<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mer gouernment, alſo to preuent that in time to come you fall not into any ſuch bottomles pit of debts, they do moſt humblye beſech you to ordeine that the treaſurers &amp; ouer ſeers of your treaſury, who hitherto haue had the ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dling &amp; diſpoſing of the ſame during the reignes aforeſaid, may come &amp; bring in an acco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pt of their adminiſtration before ſuch delegates as your ſelfe ſhal chuſe, or through the aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the eſtates euery prouince and gouernment ſhal name: by this meanes may ſuch be quailed and reuoked to their dueties, as in time to come might co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mit the like treſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pas. Again one of the firſt articles conteined in the roules which the third eſtate preſented, were theſe wordes. That ſuch might bring in their accompts as were accomptable, &amp; had had the ordering of the treaſurye, for that the ſaid thirde eſtate could not beleeue but that thereby ſundrye great abuſes might be found out: alſo that in the meane time aſwell ſuch as were accomptable, as alſo al other who had bene dealers in the treaſurie, euen being of the priuie counſaile, might neuertheleſſe be forbidden entrie into the ſaid council, together with the execution of their ſaid offices, vntil the ſaid accomptes were made other where then in the chamber of accompts, and in the preſence of the delegates of the eſtates, and that al reſtes and debtes were payed. alſo that eſpecial reuiew might be made of the accompts of thoſe who had receiued the particular loanes of the ſommes of eight, ſix, foure and two crownes, the twenty frankes of eche ſteple, the munitions and victuals, the furnitures of the ſales of wines and other neceſſary things for the warres, the money leuied vpon the walled townes after the battaile of S.

be reuoked without exception of any perſon, ſauing the Queene mother, (who had ſollicited the eſtates to purſue theſe matters, for the cauſes rehearſed in the diſcourſe of her gouernement) for that it was euident that this money had neuer bene employed vnto ſuch vſe as it had bene de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtined vnto, namely, the relieuing of the kings affaires now may we wel thinke whether theſe motions clawed the Gui<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſians. The Cardinal more ſtaied the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his brother the Duke, made no ſhew of ought, as if he had ſought to make ready his accompts. but in the others forhead a man might reade a thouſand threats againſt the eſtate of the realme, the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects whereof appeared within fiue or ſix moneths after. For their better prouiding therefore for their own affairs, they determined as touching the giuing vp of their ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compts, that they would practiſe al meanes poſſible, rather then be brought into any ſuch neceſſitie, alſo that in caſe vnder pretence of religion they found no way, then would them ſelues endeuour to make one, by aſſociating to them their partakers, and ſo falling vpon the Proteſtantes, who they were aſſured that the Prince of Condie, the Admiral &amp; other Lords would defe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d: &amp; by this meanes they ſhould ſo mingle theſe accompts, that together with forreine ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cours they would exalt themſelues higher then euer, and hauing this faire prete<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of religion, they co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſequently did aſſure the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues of the fauour of al Catholikes. Moreouer the Cardinal beholding ſuch numbers of people dayly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring themſelues proteſtants, according to his wont, ſmi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>led in his ſleue, ſaying that this was the reward of the ſoul<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>diers who had more need, and a proper meane to content manye both great and ſmal, who ſought nought but the ſpoile.</p>
            <p>The diſputation alſo at Poiſſy betweene the miniſters who were to treat vpon religion, &amp; the Prelates who alſo were called to helpe to pay the Kinges debtes, was freely graunted vnto, which was in hope to moue ſome contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſie betweene them and the Germaines that held with the confeſſion of Ausbourg, either (peraduenture becauſe

Now had they alreadye ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken the Kinge of Nauarre, by meanes of the Lorde d' Eſcars: that wall muſte they therefore wholy pul downe, to the ende that gatheringe vp the ſtones thereof, they might with the ſame ſtone the proteſtants, as afterwarde they did: Large promiſes were thereunto requiſite, wherein the Popes legate and the Kinge of Spaynes ambaſſadour, at the Guiſians ſuite did luſtily ſet to their helpe.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:16276:62"/>
diuers articles touching the inſtitution of Biſhops, the dignitie of Cathedral Churches, and ſuch other like, but not mentioning anie one point of doctrine: For they al were before agreed not to yeelde anie thing vnto the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters, for feare of being taken for ſeducers, and ſo of making an irreparable breach in the dignitie of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh ſeate. In this wiſe did the Cardinal ſcorne the King and al his council, who pretended to anie reformation.</p>
            <p>The miniſters of the reformed Churches in the Realme, were willed to ſend thither ſome of their fellowes, and ſo they did, therin obeying the commandements of the King and the Queene mother. Peter Martyr and Theodore Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>za were brought from Zurich and Geneua, where they profeſſed diuinitie, to the end more preciſely to conſider of al controuerſies. The Cardinal then ſeing him ſelfe to farre ſhipped in matters wherein he was but a nouice, thought to preuent it. So ſoone therefore as Theodore Beza was come, he went to him into the Queene mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers chamber, where after certaine talke he was forced to ſay to the ſayd Beza, that he was glad he had heard him ſpeake, alſo that be hoped they ſhould wel enough agree together. But this was but diſſimulation, as the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die of Curſol at his departure ſhewed him, ſaying, that for that night he was become an honeſt man, but in the morning he woulde be turned: as more playnely appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in that his ſuppoſtes did publiſh abroade, that the Cardinal had ſtopped Beza his mouth, and brought him to his opinion. But when the contrarie was ſeene in the oration of the ſayde Beza, the Cardinal was ſo abaſhed, that beeing among the Doctours and Prelates, he coulde not but ſay, I woulde to God that that man, (meaning Beza) had either bene dombe, or our ſelues deafe: Thereunto perceiuing that they muſt anſwere, it was thought expedie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t that a Sorboniſt named Deſpe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, an aſſured ſeruant of the houſe of Guiſe, together with cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine others ſhould pen the oration which the ſaid Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal did afterward pronounce, wherein nothing anſwering
<pb facs="tcp:16276:62"/>
to the Miniſters propoſitions, they determined to ſtand vpon two only pointes, namely of the Church, and of certaine queſtions thereupon dependinge: alſo of the Lordes Supper: wherein he did nothing, but playſter vp certaine ſophiſtical ſyllogiſmes, and therefore I thought it ſuperfluous here to inſerte the ſame oration, which more fitly may be ſeene in the hiſtory of our time. After the end of this oration, followed certaine ample diſcourſes of Deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence, Sainctes, and other Ieſuites and Monckes whom the Miniſters ſufficiently anſwered. Now was the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal gladde to ſet eche party in a heat with other, to the ende that the audience being vexed, all might be refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to ſome conference either priuatly or in writing, whileſt in the meane time the Pope might ſend ſome new precept wherewith to ſtoppe the Prelates mouthes, who waited for nothing els: hauing for certaine moneths thus debated, when the Queene perceiued that the Miniſters and Prelates could not in any one pointe agree, no not ſo much as in the article of worſhiping of Images, alſo that the Prelats &amp; Doctours did not very wel agree in the ſame poinct, ſhe brake vp the ſaid diſputation, whereof the Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boniſtes were ſo gladde, that they could not refraine from ſhewing a thouſand tokens of friendſhip vnto Theodore Beza their principall enemie, out of whoſe handes they eſcaped better then they hoped for: But the Cardinal had procured the Pope to write vnto the Prelates, that vnder payne of Excommunication, they ſhould referre the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination of ſuch controuerſies vnto the council of Trente, which came in good time for thoſe our maſters who were then ſore buſied. As for the confeſſion of Auſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourg which was the trappe, whereinto the Cardinal ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped to haue brought the Miniſters, they ſo wiſely behaued them ſelues, that he ſtumbled thereinto ſo that all the ſhame returned vpon him ſelfe.</p>

The Conſtable thereby beganne by litle and litle to be offended with his ſaid nephues, but eſpecially after he was certified that they togither with the Queene mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, had bene the chiefe motioners of the eſtates to call for accomptes: for in them ſhould him ſelfe be examined, notwithſtanding he were not by twenty partes ſo deepe as the ſaid Guiſians. Hauing thus wonne the principal officer of the crown, they aſſociated to them the Marſhal of S. An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drewes, who was as all men doe know, one of the moſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comptable. Then tooke they counſayl among them ſelues, wherein the Cardinal alwayes vſed this policie, namely to propound Religion the better to cloke his intents, &amp; made this reſolution. Firſt that the ſuperintendence of al affaires ſhould be committed vnto the Catholike King, who ſhould in the beginning accuſe the king of Nauarre as a fauorer of a new Religion: &amp; ſhould ſollicite him through fayre pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes to forſake all, and to take the Catholickes parte: In caſe the King of Nauarre remaine obſtinate, then ſhould the Spaniard, in continewing his gloſing promiſes ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times accompanied with threates, in winter time rayſe ſouldiers, and then on a ſuddein ſet vpon him. Alſo if there they ſhould finde any reſiſtance, then ſhould the Duke of Guiſe declare him ſelfe captaine of the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licke Confeſſion, and ſo goe and aſſayle the ſaid King
<pb facs="tcp:16276:63"/>
of Nauarre on another ſide, who by that meanes ſhould ſoone be ouerthrowne. The Emperour and Catholicke Germaine Princes, ſhould be requeſted to hinder the Nauarrians of all ſuccour. The Catholickes ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teine the Proteſtant Switzers: The Duke of Sauoye ſhould aſſayle and vtterly roote out the Geneuians to the terrour of all others.</p>
            <p>Thus much touching the firſt poinct of their league. Now as for France, they determined not to pardon any one who had bene knowen once to haue bene a prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtante. The commiſsion for the murder was allotted to the Duke of Guiſe, who alſo had the charge of rooting out the whole race of the Bourbons, for feare leſt in time to come any one of their progenie ſhould haue reuenged the ſame murders, and reſtored the Goſpel.</p>
            <p>Then ſhould they haue rayſed warre againſt the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Princes, and haue lent the Emperour and the Catholicke Princes all the money ariſing of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiſcations of ſo many Proteſtantes as ſhould be murde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in France: and the Cardinals, Biſhops, and other holy fathers ſhould be cottized to furniſh the expenſes of this holy warre.</p>
            <p>Theſe goodly articles did the Cardinall deuiſe. And the Conſtable minding nothing but his religion, was then ſo daſeled, that he could not perceiue that not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding his family were not named, yet the hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of Chaſtillon and Bourbon being ouerthrowne, his race could not continue. As for the Marſhall of ſaint An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drewes, he was gladde to ſee the accoumptes in this wiſe rendered, for that in ſteade of reſtoring the moſt, becauſe he had moſt receiued, he now hoped vpon a newe receipt, and of neuer being coumptable for any thing: and beſides that the Guiſians tended to the ſame ende, they did moreouer perſwade them ſelues at that blow to be bathed in all their enemies blood.</p>
            <p>For the bringing therefore of theſe things to effect, the
<pb facs="tcp:16276:64"/>
Guiſians departed from the Court about the end of No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uember, manifeſting their diſcontentation, which ſone af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter did more augment by reaſon of certaine proceedings houlden againſt the Duke of Nemours, whom they had procured to ſteale away, &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uey the lorde of Orleans into Lorraine, where hauing him at their deuotion, they purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to make him captaine of their enterpriſe. For at all aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſayes, they ſought to haue ſundry ſtrings vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> one bow, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they yet knewe not which way the Queene mother would take. Howbeit thinking that in caſe the King of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uarre would take their parte, ſhe durſt not ioyne with the Prince of Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de for feare of being diſplaced, they ſought to bring their firſt purpoſe to paſſe, by the ayde of Deſtars &amp; others, through bringing him into a vaine hope of being reſtored to his dominions. Wherunto the Pope (as ſaid his Legate, who was one of the chief ſolliciters of the matter) would aſſiſte him, prouided alwayes that the ſaid King of Nauarre would defend the Romiſh Churche: the effect whereof did ſone appeare, when the ſaid King draue away the Miniſters, and reuolted from the Religion: by reaſon whereof there fell out many doubtes about the publica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and verifying of the ſaid Edict of Ianuarye.</p>

Vpon this cauſe they came to Sauerne not farre from Strasbourg, where they had ſuch confere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce with the ſaid Prince about the fiftenth of February 1561, that al of them hauing prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted to follow the doctrine of the ſaid co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>feſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Auſbourg, &amp; the Cardinal hauing for the ſame purpoſe co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ferred with Brentius the Duke of Wirte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>berges principal Miniſter, the Duke of Guiſe did finally entreat this Prince that in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour of their Religion, he would ſo labour the reſt of the Proteſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t Princes, that in as much as in auncient time the houſe of Lorraine ſtil appertained vnto the Empire, now in the ſame reſpect he &amp; his brethren might be aduowed for

Princes of the ſame, bearing voice in the Imperiall diets: wherby they might withdraw and exempt them ſelues out of the king of Fra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces iuriſdictio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, hinder ſuch ſuccour as the Proteſtant Princes might ſende to them of the Religion, and with the ſame to ſtrengthen them ſelues, and finally in ſteade of recompence, afterward deſtroy the ſame Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Princes. As this Prince was at the point according to their requeſt to procure them to be receyued, newes came into Germanie of the murder of Vaſſye, which the Duke of Guiſe had executed in his returne into France from the aforeſayde towne of Sauerne. The Proteſtant Princes greatly wondered hereat, and that not without cauſe, ſeeing it was in maner ſcarce three dayes betweene the time that the Cardinal gaue with the one hand ſiluer and gilt cuppes to Brentius &amp; other Germaine miniſters, and that nowe with the other he ſacked the Proteſtantes. But they had before determined to come ſtrongly and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med into the citie of Paris, and thence to the Court, to the ende to be ſure both of the towne, and of the King and Queene mothers perſons, and ſo the more eaſely to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe their conſpiracies. And to the ende to finde ſome honeſt couer for the Duke of Guiſes returne into France, he cauſed the King of Nauarre to call him home: howbeit he could not temper his rage vntil he came to the Court, but did diſcharge the ſame vpon the inhabitants of Vaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſye, as is afore ſayde, beeing garded with men of armes, according to a determinatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> concluded vpon aboue three monethes before, namely that euery man ſhould entiſe as many Gentlemen and men of armes as was poſſible, war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning them to meete in their furniture nere vnto Paris, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the beginning of March, whereof the Queene mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and the King of Nauarre had bene ſufficiently aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſed, and yet in ſtede of prouiding thereagainſt, they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred their matters from day to day, ſo that eche played his parte after a ſtrange maner, and al in one tragedie. The Duke of Guiſe met at the time appoynted at Nantueil, where other his fautors did ſoone meete with him, whoſe
<pb facs="tcp:16276:65"/>
purpoſe a man may eaſely coniecture, in that moſt of them comming thither there receyued their Eaſter rights, &amp; put them ſelues in ſuch eſtate, as like men do vſe to doe when they thinke them ſelues nere vnto any daungerous enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe. In the meane time, the Queene mother was coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſailed that for the eſchewing of theſe troubles, it were meete to keepe the Duke of Guiſe (being armed contrary to the Kings ordinances) fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> paſſing through Paris, where the Prouoſt of Marchants and other of the principall did wayte for him: whereupon ſhe diuers times ſent for him to come to her vnto her houſe at Monceaux, where he ſhold be welcome, expreſſely forbidding him all entrie into Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris in ſuch array, for the auoyding of ſuch inconueniences as ſhe foreſawe likely to enſue: conſidering alſo the execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and ſlaughter lately by him committed at Vaſſy, for the which all men earneſtly cryed vpon the King and her for iuſtice, and in reſpect of the ſame, al the realme was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleniſhed with complaintes and lamentations. Hereunto the Duke of Guiſe aunſwered, that he could not come to her, for that he had enough to doe to feaſt and to welcome ſuch his friends as were come to viſite him. Then after that the Queene had the ſecond time written to him to come, he made no anſwere, but hauing receiued his friends, did according to the reſolution afore taken touching their en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpriſe, take his iourney on the one ſide, &amp; accompanied with his adherentes, came into Paris by S.

            <p>The Guiſians hauing ſtrook this firſt ſtroke againſt the Kinges authoritie, and the eſtate of the Realme, procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded on, and in Paris beganne to holde priuate councils.
<pb facs="tcp:16276:65"/>
Hereupon the Queene mother lying at Monceaux, and hauing dayly aduertiſementes, that the Guiſians intended to ſeaſe vpon the Kinges perſon and her, determined ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtily to departe and retire into ſome place of aſſurance. Shee came therefore to Melune, minding to get to Orle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, there to wayte in broader day light, to ſee howe mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters wente, which nowe began to come to great confuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: But the Guiſians ſent the Prouoſt of Marchantes to crye after her, that vnleſſe ſhe returned, Paris and all was loſt, becauſe the Prince of Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de was in armes, &amp; the Pari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſians naked: and he ſo laboured, that the rebels had their weapons deliuered them, whereby to fortifie the Duke of Guiſe and his faction agaynſt their enemies, and ſo to haue the redier opportunitie to ſeaſe vpon the Kings per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. Alſo the more to haſten their woorke, they got the King of Nauarre vnto Paris, for this Prouoſt of Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants inceſſantly cryed out at the Court, that the King of Nauarres preſence was moſt neceſſary in Paris, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe the troubles, but through the Guiſians driftes al was contrarie. For ſo ſoone as he was come, they helde coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils more narrowly then before, wherein among other things they determined, thorowly to aſſure them ſelues of Paris, and thence to driue away the Prince of Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de, as the only hinderer of their enterpriſe, touching the ſeaſing vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the King and Quene mother, and their bringing to Paris, to the end there hauing the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> at co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, to proſecute vnder their name and authoritie, their whole determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. Finally, they did ſo much that they got the place, &amp; toke the King &amp; Queene mother, &amp; brought them to the Louure: This done, notwithſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding whatſoeuer the cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers &amp; others declaratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, it was fully concluded to arreare open warre againſt the Prince of Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de and his adherents.</p>
            <p>During theſe matters, the Prince of Conde ſent to the King his proteſtation and declaration, conteining the cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes that had moued him to take weapo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, namely to the end to reſtore the King and his mother to their ful liberties, &amp; to mainteine the Edictes, but eſpecially the laſt which tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched

Now the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal of Lorraine, his brethren and their adherents, conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering that nowe there were two eſpeciall pointes which they muſt needes craftily cloke, namely the Kings capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uitie, and the breaking of the Edict of Ianuarie, did dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently procure the diſpatch of a declaration bearing date the eight of Aprill, wherein they cauſe the King to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>feſſe that the report of his captiuitie is a falſe and ſlaunderous lye, which the Prince of Conde and his partakers haue in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uented to excuſe his owne dealings, and that he and the Queene were in as free libertie as euer before, alſo that of their own accorde they came to Paris, there to prouide agaynſt theſe troubles. Theſe letters were ſoone allowed in the Parliament of Paris, where were many of the Guiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans creatures. The playnlier alſo to ſcorne the King and al the realme, they inuented in their opinions an other craf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty deuiſe, for within eight or ten dayes after theſe letters, they procured others, wherein it was declared that the Prince of Conde vnder a falſe and fayned pretence of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, was perſonally ſeaſed vpon by certaine ſeditious perſons, who had him now in their poſſeſſion.</p>
            <p>Alſo to the ende to haue one full blowe at the Edict of Ianuarie, they in the ſame moneth diſpatched other let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, wherin in the Kinges name they gaue out that he had bene aduertiſed, how that diuers numbers of people were retired to Orleans and other places, vnder colour of a certayn pretended feare of being ſearched in their conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, and reſtrained from the benefite of the Edict of Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuarie: He therefore declareth that he intendeth not to reuoke this Edict except within Paris, the ſuburbs &amp; bayli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wicke of the ſame, where he will permit no other exerciſe then of the Romiſh religion.

But getting nought that way (for he had diſcouered their em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſhments, and had both in the Realme and abroad forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied him ſelfe agaynſt the ſame) they now proceeded vnto violence, murdering the proteſtants in diuers townes of the Realme, and with incredible viole<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce aſſaulting certayn places, whither the ſayd Proteſtantes had for their owne ſafeties withdrawen them ſelues.

were wel armed and reſolued to fight, being compounded of the moſt valiaunt French Lordes, Captaines and ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers. The Guiſians therefore doubting the trial, hoped by their iourneys to and fro to diſperſe his armie, wherin the Queene mother and the King of Nauarre were emploied. In the meane time, they daily ſurpriſed ſome places which the Proteſtants helde, gathered vp money, &amp; called ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers out of all countreyes to the ſpoyle, and ſeeing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues at the point to be beaten, about the ende of Iune through the ayde of the King of Nauarre they obteyned truce, and within two dayes after, the Duke of Guiſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted from the campe at Baugencie with diuers others, whereupon they immediatly ſent the Prince of Conde worde, that according to his requeſt the Duke of Guiſe &amp; his partakers were returned to their owne houſes. Nowe was the Queene mother inſtructed what communication ſhe ſhould vſe toward the Prince of Conde and the reſt of the proteſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts: as did manifeſtly appeare in a letter which the Duke of Guiſe wrote to his brother the Cardinall of Lorraine, dated the 25. day of Iune, which being ſurpriſed, to the ende the playnlier to ſet forth theſe good peoples wittes, I haue here inſerted as foloweth. I doe ſende vnto you (writeth he) this bringer with all ſpeede, to let you vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtande, that yeſterday al things were agreed, and I may ſay vnto you, that ſome are farre wide of their accomptes. Our mother (the Queene) and his brother (the King of Nauarre) ſweare no other but by the faith that they owe vs, alſo that they will take no counſaile but of thoſe whom you wot. To conclude, the reformed Religion, in well go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerning our ſelues, and ſtanding ſtifly vnto the ende, as we wil do, wil come to nought, and the Admirals partie be as euil handled as it poſſible. Al our power remaineth whole, &amp; theirs is broken, and their townes yelded, without any ſpeach of either edictes or preachings, or adminiſtration of Sacraments after their maner. The next day after the Duke of Guiſes and his partakers departure, the Prince of Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de went to ſubmit him ſelf in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> hands of his brother the
<pb facs="tcp:16276:68"/>
King of Nauarre and of the Queene mother at Baugency, paſſing through the midſt of the Guiſians armie to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> great dau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ger of his own perſon: The Quene mother being come to Talſy a village hard by, did there ſufficiently giue to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand to the Prince of Conde, the Admirall and other Lords whom ſhe had ſent for thither, that her ſelf was the Guiſians aſſured inſtrume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, wherby to mainteyn &amp; ſupport troubles and partialities in the realme. For ſhe told them flatly, that they muſt not loke to haue the edict of Ianuarie obſerued, neither that in France ſhould be any other reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion vſed then the Romiſh, alſo that the Catholiks were ſo ſtrong &amp; therwith ſo chafed, eſpecially at Paris, that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out further tumults the ſaid edict could not be kept: wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they ought to be content in being tolerated to liue quietly in their owne houſes, without any ſlaunder or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſearched in their conſciences, prouided alwayes that they practiſed no preachings, adminiſtratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, or other exerciſes of their religion. The Guiſians alſo reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bring how diuers times before, the ſaid Prince of Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de &amp; his adherents had declared (which la<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>guage they now alſo vſed vnto the Queene) that rather then for their partes to agree to the forcing of their co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſciences, or to to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerate any thing contrary to Gods honour, or his worde, they would depart the realme, &amp; incurre perpetual exile, did now expreſſely aduertiſe the Quene that at this parly ſhe ſhould reduce the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> againe to the ſame co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munication, &amp; then take the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> at their word, which ſhe both promiſed and diligently brought to paſſe. For hauing declared to the Prince &amp; his partakers, that their proteſtations touching the maintenance of the edicts &amp; religion were not recey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueable, ſhe did very liberally yelde to the other point, na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mely that their beſt was to withdrawe them ſelues out of France, promiſing to procure vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as well generally as particularly, al ſuch letters of aſſurance as the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſelues would deuiſe: then acco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pting her ſelf aſſured of their departure, ſhe began to diſcourſe with the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the time whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the king ſhould come out of his nonage, ſhewing them y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> there were

Yet was ſhe not content ſo accurſedly to mainteine both the Guiſians &amp; her owne am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition, but that ſhe muſt needes the ſame night after ſhe came from Talſye, diſpatch Ramboillet, to the ende in the morning to be at the ſaid Princes vpriſing, to haſte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture of him &amp; his, &amp; to bring her worde of the aſſured houre &amp; time of their ſaid departure out of the Realm, wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting vnto the ſaid prince, that ſhe would ſend him ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand crownes to what part ſoeuer he we<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, therin manifeſtly declaring her ſelf the inſtrume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of the ſaid Guiſians wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with to baniſh him: ſo that hereby euery man may perceiue what way poore France was like to goe through ſuch ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſed gouernement.</p>
            <p>The Prince hereupon returned with ſuch lords as acom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied him into his owne ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pe, hauing firſt reueiled to the Queene mother certain of the Guiſians practiſes, whereby they endeuored to haue apprehended him in his returne from the ſaid parlye, which he had diſcouered. But all this notwithſtanding, they were ſo wide from quayling his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancie, that contrariwiſe being fully reſolued to mainteine the liberty and lawes of his countrie, and to doe his duety vnto God &amp; the Church againſt the enemies, he twiſe of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered them battayle. But the Duke of Guiſe and his friends (who ſo greatly before truſted in their power, knowledge and experience, as to preſume to ſay, euen before the Kings face, that with three hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dred men of armes they would not fayle, but ſo beate the Huguenots, that for their ſafety they ſhould haue enough to doe, quickly to get into the corners of the Realme) then with all the power that they could get in ſeuen or eight dayes, togither with ſuch forces as they gathered vnder the Kings name and auctoritie, could not now otherwiſe ſhifte, but by ſtealing away and in the night

departing vnto Bloys, a towne of no ſtrength, where they found the poore inhabitants vtterly diſarmed, of whom ſome they murdered, &amp; ſome they drowned, violating wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men and maydens, and committing wonderfull hauocke: and thence, hauing that paſſage open, they went and ſac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked ſundry other townes, and forraged a great parte of the Realme. The Cardinal alſo togither with the Popes Legat followed the army to the armye, whereby to preuent all meanes of agreement, &amp; to mainteine the troubles, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of we neede no more aſſured proofe then of a certeine reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>brance which at the ſame time was met withall, which the ſaid Cardinal ſent to his brother the Duke of Guiſe and his companions, to the campe at Bloys by Seure the controuler of his ſaid brothers houſhoold. This remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance among other did conteine theſe wordes. As for breaking of or hindering whatſoeuer is newly propounded touching agreement, it is that that is the hardeſt, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teineth moſt labour: and neuer beleeue that any man ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth any heede thereto, or hearken vnto them, either that they ſhal come to any poinct, vnleſſe they ſubmit them ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues to ſuch offers, as the Queene ſaith ſhe hath made vnto them.

But the Prince and his partakers did firſt refuſe the Guiſians ſlaues, who prepared them ſel<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ues to make this declaration, and then vttereth the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iuſtice of the ſame, whereby the Cardinal gotte not much that way, ſauing that he detected his owne practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes and rebellions, as the ſaid Prince and his confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates publiſhed in their declaration to the Queene, wherein were theſe notable wordes among other. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering with a ſingle eye the parties in this cauſe, ye ſhall finde that the ſaid lorde Prince and his confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates, haue bene wrongfully declared rebelles by thoſe who are ſo in deede. The procurers of all the troubles happened in this Realme, ſince the death of the late King Henry, are the declarers of the ſaid Prince and his fautours to be ſeditious. They who doe oppreſſe the Kings maieſtie, aboliſh his decrees, and abuſe his name and auctority, to the ende with his ouerthrowe to eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh their owne mightineſſe, are the ſame who haue de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared vs guilty of treaſon. Thoſe thoſe are guilty of trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon againſt God, whoſe workes haue alweys ſhewed that ambition is their God, couetouſnes their religion, and worldly pleaſures their paradiſe and laſt felicitie: who haue ſworne warre againſt the Sonne of God, his worde, and the defenders of the ſame: who ſhew the deedes of Anabaptiſtes, in rebaptiſing children baptiſed accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the ordinaunce of IESVS CHRIST: whoſe houſes are repleniſhed with thefte, and their handes bloody in all crueltye. Thoſe men alſo are guilty of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine treaſon, who haue violated the Kinges edictes,

armed them ſelues contrary to his commaundement, and ſeaſed vpon his royall perſon: who are inwarde friendes, and to the ſame ende doe vſe the helpe of thoſe, who in ſeeking to ſteale away the ſecond perſon of the Realme, endeuored to oppreſſe the King, &amp; to bring his eſtate into ruine &amp; confuſion. And ſeing we muſt needes proceed, I ſay that thoſe men are guilty of treaſon, who lately made a conſpiracy in Prouence through the ayde of Lauris a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſident in the Parliament of Aix, togither with Fabritius Cerbelone the Popes gouernour of Auignon, te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding to the raiſing of fiftenth thouſand men, who as they ſware, mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched at the comma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dement of the Duke of Guiſe, of whom the ſaid Fabritius furniſhed a thouſand footemen, and two hundred horſe: which conſpiracy being detected, and in the court of Parliament of Prouence, verified: Entrages and Laydet the two chiefe captaines of this faction were beheaded by ſentence of the ſaid courte. If this be not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient, I wil ſay yet more, namely that the Guiſians made the like match in Dauphine by meanes of captaine Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til: hoping to arme the ſaid two prouinces, &amp; then to cauſe them togither to march where they thought beſt. So that theſe conſpiracies made for the aboliſhing of the prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching of the Goſpel, theſe leauyings of men, and this othe, to marche at the Duke of Guiſes commandement, doe crye out that he and his confederates are rebels, ſeditious perſons, and guilty of treaſon againſt both God &amp; man: Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo that contrariwiſe, thoſe are the Kings true and faithfull ſeruantes, who both haue and ſtill doe valiantly withſtand their rebellions, ſeditions, and attemps againſt the Kings maieſty, and the eſtate of this Realme. Alſo hereof aboue all that is yet ſpoken, the ouerthrowe of the policy, and ſubuerſion of the iuſtice of this Realme, togither with the peruerting of the court of Parliament of Paris, may be a ſufficient teſtimonye: The ayde of which court they haue vſed in this falſe and pernicious iudgement of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion, becauſe they could not light vpon any other co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſo corrupted &amp; depraued, either ſo much bound to their

went to practiſe with the Pope, the Spanierd and others aſſembled vnto the Councill of Trent, and all vnder co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour of religion, which he did openly ſcoffe at: for at Gyen and Bloys among other the articles whereunto he cauſed the King &amp; his council to ſubſcribe, to the end they might (ſaid he) paſſe in the Cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cil, though in effect to bring the Pope and his adherentes to that whereat he ſhot, were theſe fiue, wherin his practiſes may plainely be perceiued. Firſt that the Canon of the Maſſe might be cut of, and the reſt corrected according to the forme of al auncient litur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gies, &amp; brought into Frenche. Secondly, that the Pſalmes might be ſou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g in Churches after the maner of that Fre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ch tranſlation which the doctors of Sorbone had corrected, who in deede are as rude Poets, although they loue their drinke well, as euill diuines. Thirdly, that indifferently al men might participate in the Lordes Supper vnder both kinds. Fourthly, that al flat paintings tending to the ſtorie only, ſhould be permitted in Churches, &amp; al Images taken away: or at the leaſt wiſe the people ſhuld be exhorted not to worſhip any of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> either ſimplie or by relation.

The better to frame his ginnes, he got forth with him nine biſhops, foure Abbots, and certaine Sorboniſtes, and arriued at Trent in Nouember 1562. wherevpon the twentye thirde daye of the ſame moneth he made an oration conteining ſome matters worth the noting.</p>

Afterward he ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth mention of the reformation of the church, and doth conclude with his own ſubmiſſion to the Romiſh Church. Now let the reader conſider the purpoſe of this ſpeach. And from that time forward he ſtil practiſed againſt the eſtate of the realme, from whence he dayly receiued let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, neither was there any thing in France done without him, as hereafter we ſhal perceiue. But being now in hand with the council, we wil alſo touch ſome leagues. Immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atly after he heard of the death of his brother the Duke of Guiſe, vpon whoſe auctority his whole hope was groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, he ſodenly thought neuer to returne into France, but with his vſual inconſtancie turned his minde towarde the affaires of Italie, gratifying ſo farre forth as he could, the Pope and al forreyn princes, eſpecially the Catholike King of Spaine.</p>
            <p>Before the newes of this death, he had with the Spaniſh Biſhops ſtoode ſtifly in defence of reſidences vpon bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices againſt the Popes diſpenſations, alleaging them to proceede of the Lawe of God: but then he ſone changed his copie, mainteining with his adherents that they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed to the poſitiue Lawe, and ſo through the pluralitie of voyces bare it away, in ſo much that the Archbiſhop of Granado cryed out, that the Cardinal of Lorraine had be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>trayed them.

Wel, in Auguſt he beſieged Bourges, and in September they yelded, then did he cauſe the King and Queene to enter, and vſed mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueilous threates and outragious wordes againſt them that were yeelded. Al the Proteſtants in thoſe quarters did he worſe entreat then either Turkes or Iewes. The Duke of Aumale, and Marquiſe d'Ellebeufe lay in Normandie, the one before Rouen, and the other before Caen, and yet notwithſtanding they wanted neither greace nor grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, yet could they not greatly profit that way. The Lord of Moruilliers was at Rouen, and in S. Katherines fort was ſo good a garniſon, that the Duke of Aumale al ſommer time, did nought but loſe men and munitions. Yea, the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties beſieged, the more to laugh at him, erected certaine rampiers and bulworkes, againſt the which he waſtfully ſpent his pouder and pellets, as if he woulde haue ſcared ſparrowes. To be briefe, euerie man was a maſter in his campe, inſomuch as when a certaine boye was gotten out of Rouen to beholde, and eſpie the demeanours of him &amp; his, ſeeing euerie royſter intrude him ſelfe to counſel him and to commande in his preſence, at his returne ſaid, that there were verie manie captaines, but fewe ſouldiers: wherefore, ſaid he, you are in no danger except when the Lord of Aumale ſleepeth. In the meane time the Duke of Guiſe called in al ſtrangers, as Italians, Spanierds and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the more to trouble al things: But hearing that the Queene of England prepared to aide the Proteſtants, and
<pb facs="tcp:16276:72"/>
knowing her landing to be in Normandie, he led thither his armie, drawing with him the King and Queene mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther together with the King of Nauarre, who at the ſiege of Rouen receiued a wound whereof he ſhortly after died, being therin rewarded for ioyning with the enemies both of the crowne and of his familie. Rouen was taken, and al extremitie therein exerciſed. That done, the Duke of Guiſe returned to Paris in great perplexitie, for that the Prince hauing receiued ſuccour out of Germanie, was co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to ſeeke him. Howbeit in the meane time he recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued new ſupplies of Gaſcoynes and Spanierds, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with intended to keepe the Engliſhmen from ioyning with the Prince.</p>
            <p>Hereof followed the battayle of Dreux fought in De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cember, the effect whereof al men do knowe.<note place="margin">The battai<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> of Dreux.</note> But as the Duke of Guiſes refuſing to giue the onſet when the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtable ſent him word, which cauſed the ſaid Conſtables ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, procured men to iudge that willingly he ſought this chance, ſo did others who ſuppoſed better to knowe his nature, attribute it to his cowardlines: and thereof did men take their argument, to aſſure them ſelues of al that which ſince that battayle this braue warrier hath compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed. For al men wil confeſſe that after this battaile of Dreux, al the Proteſtants power conſiſted in the band, which the Admiral kept in the fieldes, and not in the citie of Orleans which was impregnable, for the ſaid Admiral remained ſafe. And therefore it had bene reaſon that the Duke of Guiſe had aſſailed him, who beeing ouercome, Orleans would haue ſtretched forth her hands: and not in ſuch wiſe to haue waſted his men, money, munition &amp; forces, about the taking of a towne, which being wonne &amp; razed, ſhould but haue made the Admiral more ſtrong, warie and diligent about new and dangerous enterpriſes. Thereof did men conclude that the Duke of Guiſe wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted both wit and courage, in that he neither coulde, ne durſt followe the Admiral at his retire out of Normandie, but did ſuffer him ſo to fortifie him ſelf with townes, holds,
<pb facs="tcp:16276:73"/>
fortreſſes, men, money and al other munitions. Yea, the moſt valiant &amp; expert captaines of France do thinke cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly, that in caſe y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> warre had a litle while lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ger co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinued, the Admiral had giuen the Duke of Guiſe an immortal re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proch, who at Dreux durſt not looke in his face, neither at his comming out of Orleans to go into Normandie, fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe at his backe: notwithſtanding the ſaid Admiral was but ſlenderly accompanied at his comming out of the ſaid beſieged citie, and yet paſſed part of France, and euen be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the ſaid Duke of Guiſes face forced certaine townes, as Touque, Caen, Falaize, Argenten, Vire and other pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in Normandie, tooke ſundrie fortreſſes and caſtles, &amp; compelled the Marquiſe d' Ellebeufe to come vnder the yoke, and yelde to his grace and mercie, notwithſtanding the ſaid Marquiſe might wel enough haue withſtood him, as hauing an vnpregnable place, namely the caſtle of Caen at commandement: But that was not his occupation, he was fitter to handle a bottle and a gambon of bacon. And in deede not long before the Admirals comming to Caen, he ſought to flee, and had not Captaine Renouard bene, he had neuer abidden the ſummons. Of him therefore did not a gentleman of Caux ſpeake much out of the waye, when as after the firſt troubles, at the ſame time that the Kings armie feared, that it woulde be long before they could recouer New hauen, he counſayled them to cauſe the Marquiſe d' Ellebeufe to enter thereinto: for, ſaid he, there is no forte ſo ſtrong, ſo well defended or ſo impregnable, but that he immediatly wil yelde the ſame.</p>
            <p>In the meane time, the Cardinal hearing of the battaile of Dreux, ſaid, Al is wel ſeing my brother is eſcaped. Is there no more talke of calling vs to accompts? and then turning vnto two biſhops of his familiars, he ſaid to them ſmiling, So farre as I perceiue, my brother muſt take his accompts, him ſelfe alone: now is it as I deſired. The King of Nauarre was dead, The Marſhal of S. Andrewes was ſlaine, the Prince of Conde was priſoner on the one
<pb facs="tcp:16276:73"/>
ſide, and the Conſtable on the other: now was it as he deſired. Now did he and his brother feare none but the Queene mother, whoſe inconſtancie and ſubtilties they were to conquere. To the attaining therefore to their purpoſe, they thought it neceſſarie to gette Orleans, thereby to intrappe the Lord d'Andelot, whome they did both doubt and hate, alſo to recouer the Conſtable, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he might be wholy at their mercie, if peraduenture they had not cauſed him to be made away in the heate of his taking. They were in poſſeſſion of the Prince of Conde, who ſhould not verie cheape depart out of their hands: and although they ſawe the Admiral on foote, yet hoped they in time to mate him. They made therefore at one flight fortie Knights of the order, and deuided the compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of men of armes vnto men of their own retinue. And the Duke of Guiſe not long before his hurt, ſufficiently diſcouered him ſelfe: for when one of his familiars mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued him to followe the Admiral, he anſwered, That per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chance wil not be the moſt commoditie to manie, in caſe they ſhoulde ſo ſoone be ouercome: the cardes are not throughly ſhuflled, I haue a worſe beaſt to ouercome then al the Huguenots together, ſpeaking of the Queene, of whome manie times priuately he complained, ſaying, that ſhe was verie vnthankeful to him ward, alſo that cloſely ſhe woue ſome webbe with the Prince of Conde: But, ſaid he, if God wil, who knoweth the wrong done to our houſe, (ſpeaking of the Counties of Prouence and Anjou, and of the crowne alſo) I wil come to an end with them al, and whatſoeuer it coſt, ſeeing my ſhare is therein, I wil haue iuſtice before the game be at an end. The wickedneſſe of his deſire was yet more plainely perceiued by an other word which he ſpake, at his making of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> laſt Knights of the order (among whom his ſonne Henrie yet more meete to play with nutſhales, then to handle a ſword, was one of the firſt) when it was obiected what a reproch it would be to ſo manie worthie men and noble Lordes as were alreadie of the ſame, in caſe he ſhould put in ſome of thoſe whome
<pb facs="tcp:16276:74"/>
he had named: you, ſaid he, do not know my meaning. There be ſome ſaid he (ſpeaking of the Queene) who ſeke to liue in confuſion, and therefore we muſt put in ſo many, that the diſorder may bring good order. This may you ſee was his care ouer the eſtate of the realm: but we may here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in perceiue how he defaced himſelf. In the battel of Dreux the Conſtable was taken fighting valiantly: the Marſhal of S. Andrewes was ſlaine in the ſame place: The Duke of Guiſe coulde not auoyde without ſhame and diſhonour, after hee had refuſed to ſet vpon the Huguenots when his captaine commaunded him, and had abandoned his generall in the middeſt of the field. In this battell did he no honorable deede, but loſt the honour of the Prince of Condies taking, who lighted in the Lord of Danuils ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds: But to his great confuſion, he had before him the Admiral onely, of whom he had ſpoken ſo much ſhame, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore before al men ſuſteined this reproch, that with al his power he durſt not aſſaile him whome before he had ſo much deſpiſed, and who by his ſaying was deſtitute of all vertue, valiantneſſe and grace in commanding. The thing which moſt ſpited the Duke of Guiſe, was in that he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued himſelfe bridled by the yelding of New hauen to the Engliſhmen, which vnto them was graunted vpon ſun<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dry not very vnequal conditions, conſidering the time: &amp; this cauſed the Cardinal and the reſt of his brethren to bite their nailes, ſeeing newe worke now cut out for them in an other place. Now they did in maner accompt aſſured<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly, that this matter was neuer done without ſome practiſe of the Queene mother, with the Prince of Condie &amp; the Admiral, and therfore did through the meanes of certain their ſecret ſeruants, counſel the King of Spaine to aske the cuſtodie of ſome townes to the King of Frances behoofe, putting the Spaniard in hope that they would procure his requeſt to be granted, if he had bene as vniuſt and fooliſh as to haue demaunded the ſame. The Duke of Guiſes fret<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ting alſo a litle before his wounding at Orleans, which himſelfe diſcloſed to a certaine familiar friend is not alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
<pb facs="tcp:16276:74"/>
vnknowen: for he ſaid that he repented himſelf, in that he deliuered not two townes to the Spanierdes in ſteade of one which the Engliſhmen poſſeſſed: for that, ſaid he, had bene the way to bridle the inconſtancie wher<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>with he charge the Queene, and the enuie and ielouzy, which, ſaid he, ſhe bare to his greatnes, beſides the means y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> this might haue bene to do ſome thing for his own fami<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lie, which openly he would not diſcouer: and yet could he not ſo cloſely keepe his game, but that in ſaying that he had by this meanes a ſhare in the lumpe as the reſt, a man might diſcerne (together with other wordes which he ſpake) whether he were minded to giue the realm in pray, and ſo haue a portion therein.</p>

But in the middeſt of al his deuiſes, Poltrot ſhotte a dagge at him, whereby he lanquiſhed certayne dayes in terrible tormentes, not without won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull griefe, for that he perceiued him ſelfe cutte of in the middeſt of his courſe. Sometimes he woulde thruſt his finger into the wounde, as if he were extremely cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fed againſt the ſurgeons and Phyſitions, who coulde not prolonge Francis the ſecond his life, alſo as if he coulde not giue them one good looke, becauſe he ſawe himſelfe enſnared. Finally after he had forgiuen his wife, and lefte his children to the Cardinals tuition, not without ſtraight charge to reuendge his death, and bring his driftes to their perfection which ſo often had bene fruſtrated, he was (as ye would ſay) by death tyed to the ſuburbes and gate of Orleans. This was the end of the fierceſt of all the Guiſians, who fretted (ſaid manye) in that he ſhoulde die in the towne where a King had dyed, either that nowe aliue he ſhoulde come into the Citie which he and his
<pb facs="tcp:16276:75"/>
partakers had deſtined for the death of a Prince of the blood, and many good officers of the crowne. The Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likes eſpecially of Paris (who neuertheleſſe had ſmal cauſe as afterward appeared) did greatly bewayl his death. Whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the King of Nauarre was ſlaine at Rouen, the Duke of Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers, and the Marſhal of S. Andrews at Dreux, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers others in other places, there was no token of ſorow. But for the Duke of Guiſe, who had abandoned his cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, who fought becauſe he would not be accomptable to the eſtates of France, who had violated the Kings edictes, and ſought to ſuppreſſe the houſe of Valois, did they make hearſes, and vſed al other funeral ſolemnities as if he had bene a King. Now therefore like as after the deceaſe of Francis the ſecond, al the whole courte which enuironed the Guiſians vaniſhed away, and al their multitudes at the ſame inſtant conuerted into ſolitarineſſe, yea that manye who before had followed them, were now ready not onlye to hold y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> baſen to who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſoeuer would cut their throats, but eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues to paunch the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: ſo after y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> death of their eldeſt brother, they remained as a body without members, being forſaken of moſt men, and through the vnreaſonable au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority which they had vſurped, become odious vnto ſuch as to them were moſt vprignt. The Cardinal now being at Trente, ſought new meanes how to begin at an other end: and firſt dealt with the Spaniard, as himſelfe did ſince diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſe to one of the chiefe counſelers of a certaine noble french Lorde: for hauing declaimed againſt, and repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued the eſtate of matters of France, he toulde him that the Spayniſhe gouernement was excellent and goode, where the Great Lords of the country doe ſo bridle their King, that they permit him ſcarſely to ſport him ſelf: hand<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ling him after the maner of counters, of which a man ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth that which ſomtime is worth but one, ſomtime worth tenne, ſometimes worth a hundred, ſometimes worth ten thouſand, and immediatly reducing it againe to nothing at his pleaſure: neither were it (ſaid he) a very harde mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to reduce France to the ſame poincte. In the meane
<pb facs="tcp:16276:75"/>

            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:16276:76"/>Firſt, the Cardinal laboured the Queene mother to grant the eſtate of great maſter, vnto his nephue Henrie ſonne to the late Duke of Guiſe. So that notwithſtanding this childe was not capable thereof, yet to the great diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of the King and the Realme, and in deſpite of the Conſtable and the Proteſtants, whome the Queene be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to hate, he was choſen great Maſter, ſtanding in deede in greater neede of a Scholemaſter and roddes.</p>
            <p>After the King of Nauarre was dead, the Queen mother became a Catholike, for ſhe douted leſt the Prince of Con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>de, then firſt Prince of the blood would holde his eſtate, &amp; (knowing her humours, through the aſſiſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtillo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, &amp; the Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſtable himſelf, whoſe heate began now to coole) reduce her to order, &amp; take the gouerneme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t from her. The Cardinal foreſeing alſo, that if this were brought to paſſe, both he and al his ſhould be plucked away, deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined to take ſome order. At the aſſemblie at Orleans, the eſtates with one common conſent had made great com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaintes of the vnreaſonable giftes, which both King Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie and King Francis the ſecond had giuen to ſundrie per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, of whome ſome were vnworthie, others had had too much, ſeeking to cal to accounts thoſe who had the charge and gouernement of the treaſure. The firſt part of theſe complaintes, touching the vnworthineſſe of perſons, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned eſpecially and from the bottome of their hearts, the Ducheſſe of Valentinois, and al her abomination. The ſecond of exceſſe did pinche to the quicke the Guiſians, the Marſhal of S. Andrewes, and ſome others. An other point of this complaint tended wholy againſt the Guiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, as hauing relation only to the time of Francis the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, whom they had ordered at their pleaſures, in whoſe time much money was ſpent and conſumed. On the other ſide, the reformation of the eccleſiaſtical eſtate, wherupon the nobilitie and third eſtate did earneſtly call, killed the Cardinals heart outright. Wherefore to the end to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure this purſuite to vaniſh away, he and his brethren could inuent no better ſhift, then by kindeling the ciuil
<pb facs="tcp:16276:76"/>
warre aforeſaide. The ſame now being pacified, he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poundeth vnto the Queene mother, that to keepe the Prince of Conde from chalenging his degree, and aboli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing her gouernement, it were moſt expedient to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claime the Kings Maioritie, as alſo ſhe was minded to haue done before the King of Nauarres deceaſſe. For the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal knew that ſo long as the Queene mother was Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſe, the accomptes ſhould neuer be taken, becauſe that in permitting the eſtates to ſearche ſo narrowly the beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiours of gouernours, it was to be feared leaſt in time they would examine her ſelfe. As for the reformation of the Clergie, he propoundeth to her how profitable that would be for the aduancement of the Proteſtants, which neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily muſt enſue, for ſhe ſhould rayſe againſt her the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nierd, the Pope and the Catholikes, and ſo ſhoulde loſe her credite, and peraduenture her authoritie alſo. Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording therefore to this counſayle, ſhortly after the peace the Kings Maioritie was proclaymed, wherin the Queene mother and the Cardinal made him playe a terrible part, in procuring him to ſpeake as bigge as if he were fourtie yeres olde, when in deede it was they that ſpake with his lippes.</p>
            <p>To this counſayle the Cardinal yet added an other, tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the inſtruction of the King and of his brethren. For he ſhewed the Queene, that if ſhe ſuffred the Princes and Lords of the Religion to come neere her children, either els ſo timely trained them vp in the affaires, they might be wonne, and in time do her ſelfe ſome diſpleaſure, or at the leaſt wiſe, put her from the gouernement, and then chooſe other counſaylers, as the Bourbons, Montmoren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies and Chaſtillons. For remedie whereof, he cauſeth the King to waſt his time with a toppe and ſcourge ſticke, at cockefights, at putting dogges together by the eares, or ſetting them vpon this bodie or that bodie, in hearing of playes, ſeeing of daunces, talking with harlots: finally in ſwearing and whorehunting, and al in the Queenes pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence and knowledge, through the dealings of diuers of
<pb facs="tcp:16276:77"/>
the Guiſians ſeruants. Alſo becauſe the King of him ſelfe was wilde enough, ſomewhat to coole theſe heates, he was ſent on hunting whiles a prieſt and a woman gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the Realme.</p>
            <p>To keepe the Proteſtants alſo ſtil in breath, &amp; ſo to ſtop the King, that with the time he might not ſo fauour both the parties at once, that finally the Guiſians policies ſhould be detected, the Cardinal caught holde of an occaſion which the Queene mother had practiſed a litle before the Edict of pacification. There was a certaine, I wot not what, depoſition attributed to Poltrot, wherein he confeſſed that the Admiral had procured him to ſlaye the Duke of Guiſe: and although the Admiral hearing the bruite hereof, which la Pallet ſeruant to the Guiſians had cauſed to be noyſed among the Proteſtant Reiſtres, who were come to the Proteſtantes aide, and therewithall conſidering the conſequence thereof, had by expreſſe letters intreated the Queene mother to cauſe the ſaide Poltrot to bee repriued, to the ende to bee brought face to face, yet had ſhe by ſentence of the Parliament of Paris cauſed him to be drawen aſunder with foure horſes. Wherein was to be ſeene the cloking and wonderfull policies of the Queene mother and the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal. But as touching the Queenes practiſes, they require an other Legende. And in reſpect of the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal, he was the gladdeſt man aliue of this aduantage, whereby at his pleaſure to bring the Realme againe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to troubles, to ridde his handes of his enemies, of Bourbon, of Montmorencie, and of Chaſtillon: and indeede this iuſtice which he procured the Duke of Guiſes widowe and children to proſecute, was a verie proper meanes to helpe him ſelfe with all: For ſoone after, he yet proceeded giuing the Queene to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, that neither her regiment, neither the Kinges eſtate woulde euer be aſſured ſo long as the Bourbons, Montmorencies and Chaſtillons were on horſebacke: that it was meete to humble them, and to ſet ſo manie
<pb facs="tcp:16276:77"/>

Alſo that in caſe ſhe woulde accept of his brethren and nephues, alſo of ſuch as were affectio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate to that race, ſhe ſhoulde finde them preſt with all meanes poſſible: Againe, that ſo long as ſhe woulde miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like of the Proteſtants, moſt townes in the Realme would beſtowe their whole power to the maintenance of her and her authoritie.</p>
            <p>Moreouer, becauſe it had bene too much ſo to diſquiet all thinges at once, and a litle to hazarde them ſelues, rather then to deale with the three houſes aforeſaide together, hauing conſulted with his brethren, the ſaid Cardinal propounded to the Queene mother, that it were beſt firſt to diſpatch the Chaſtillons, whereunto the iuſtice which the Guiſians demaunded might ſerue for a colour, alſo for that it woulde be harde com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming by them by force, it were beſt in ſhewing them a good countenance to intrappe them at once. Now not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the Queene were not ignorant of the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteouſneſſe of this counſayle, alſo of ſuch confuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons as might inſue: yet preferring her owne ambition before the quietnes of her children and Realme, ſhe tooke that waye. For, although ſhe did not greatly loue the Guiſians, yet beeing aſſured that ſhe ſhould the better compaſſe her matters, alſo that they were alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die ſo deepe in theſe affaires, that they woulde with her hazarde all meanes for their preſeruation, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore nowe there was no more to doe but to finde op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunitie to bee ridde of the Chaſtillons. But when they were at the poynte to practiſe their matters, the Prince of Conde in the Kinges open counſayle tooke the Admirals matter in hande, and plainelye decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red that who ſo euer dealt with the Admirall other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe then by Lawe and equitie, he the ſayde Prince woulde not ſuffer it. This therefore together with other conſiderations, procured the counterfayt atonement be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the Admiral and the Guiſians, which was made
<pb facs="tcp:16276:78"/>
at Moulins as the King was in his iourney to Bayonne.</p>
            <p>This iourney was vndertaken through the aduice of the Queene and the Cardinal, vnder pretence of viſiting the realme: but in effect to conferre with the Spaniard, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newe a league which might reduce the realme into newe troubles, as indede it came to paſſe after this race was runne. And the whiles the Cardinal and his brethren fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med other practiſes as followeth.</p>
            <p>The Cardinal at his being at Trent had procured an af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſeſſion, thereby to publiſh the King of France to be an heretike, a ſchiſmatike, and an excommunicate perſon, in caſe he perſiſted in ſelling the demaines of the Church, although the ſame ſale was of his owne inuentions, and that he together with his brother had graunted thereto before his departure: for to the obteining of their great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes and accompliſhing of their purpoſes, nothing was ſo holy, but it might be alienated. In the ſame practiſe he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined to open and giue in ſpoyle to the firſt conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, the realme of Nauarre, becauſe of the religion which the Queen and her ſonne the Prince did profeſſe. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the King being aduertiſed, he ſent word to the Embaſſa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dors and Biſhops of his realm ſpedily to come their waies from the Council, publiſhing moreouer vehement prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtations againſt the auctours of the ſaid counſel. But here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in conſiſted an other of the Cardinals policies, who ſecret<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly alleaged that he had inuented theſe meanes ſomewhat to gratifie the Pope and the Spaniard, to whom he preſen<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ted a new praye, and on the other ſide he writte to the Queene mother, that the King muſt needes counterfait a diſcontentation hereat, whereby to allure the Queene of Nauarre, and ſo to ſeparate her from the Prince and the Chaſtillons, the readilier to diſpatch ech after other. Here vpon he returned into France, and there ſet his matters in ſuch order as ſhortlie you ſhall perceiue, and then made a new voyage vnto Rome, there perſonally to ſollicite this curſe againſt the Queen of Nauarre. And then to the end to cleare him ſelfe of ſuch miſchief, he departed two daies
<pb facs="tcp:16276:78"/>
before iudgement ſhould be giuen: from whence being arriued at Venice, he there ſharpely accuſed the Pope and conſiſtorie of Rome for tranſgreſſing the Kings pleaſure, whereby to perſwade men that he was not of that conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racie or faction.</p>

And to the ende it might haue the fayrer ſhewe, at his ſolliciting the Embaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadoures of Spayne, Sauoy and the Pope, came to the Court, and preſented certayne Articles deuiſed at the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the Cardinall and his adherentes, which here we haue ſet downe, becauſe they doe reueale the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the reſt of the troubles which ſince haue enſued in France.</p>
            <p>In the firſt point, they called vpon the King to keepe and cauſe to be kept within his owne Realme, the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, Territories and Lordſhippes in his obedience, the articles of the holy council lately holden at Trente, which now they had brought with them to the ſame ende. And for the reading of the ſame, and to ſweare thereunto be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Delegates of the ſayde councill, they aſſigned the ſayd King to be at Nancy in Lorrayne vpon our Ladie day in Marche, there to meete with their ſayde Lordes, who togyther with all other Chriſtian Kinges and Princes were determined, to make a generall conſtitution cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondent to the ſame which was made at Trente, for the rooting out of all hereſies and new doctrines repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to the ſayd holy councill.</p>
            <p>In the ſecond point they requeſted the ſayde Lorde to ceaſſe alienating the temporalities of the Church, certify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him on the behalfe of the King of Spayne, and of the Duke of Sauoy, that they neyther doe nor euer dyd meane to be payde their mariage money, which the late King Henrie had promiſed them out of the church goods:
<pb facs="tcp:16276:79"/>
and therefore that he ought to be content with ſome vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarie gifte, which the Eccleſiaſticall perſons ſhoulde giue him, hauing regarde vnto ſuch ſackes and ſpoyles, as lately haue bene committed in his Realme, vnder his name and by his Edict: whereof they doe neuertheleſſe (according as they haue bene deſired) holde him excuſed through his youth.</p>
            <p>In the thirde point, that at the leaſt wiſe he ſhould ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhe (vnleſſe he had rather otherwiſe puniſhe them) the chiefe ſeditious perſones and ſchiſmatikes of his Realme, by whoſe meanes the aforeſayd ſpoyles of Churches haue bene committed, and who haue brought the enemies of his Crowne into the Realme, and giuen ſtraungers free entrie thereinto.</p>
            <p>In the fourth, that he ſhoulde reuoke the remiſſion and abſolution, which in his Edict of pacification he had graunted, eſpecially agaynſt ſuch perſons as had commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted treaſon agaynſt GOD: ſhewing him that it was ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in him nor in any other Chriſtian King or Prince, to remitte or forgiue the offence committed agaynſt the Diuine Maieſtie, for that all ſuch remiſſion appertayneth vnto God onely.</p>
            <p>In the fifth, that he as King for his parte woulde aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſte Iuſtice, and the ſame authorize, as his predeceſſours haue done, becauſe that thereof dependeth the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie of all Chriſtian Kinges and Princes: alſo that in ſo dooing, he ſhould puniſhe the trayterous murder com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted in the perſon of the late Duke of Guiſe, by ſuch as manifeſtly are knowen: and that in ſuch caſes hee ought not to vſe any diſſimulation, conſidering what per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon he was, who ſo accurſedly was murdered. Alſo that he ſhould procure him ſelfe to be obeyed as a King, ſo that Iuſtice might floriſhe in his Realme: And that the Lordes whoſe Embaſſadours they are, doe offer vnto him all ayde and helpe, ſo ſoone as he the ſayd King ſhall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunde the ſame.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:16276:79"/>Euer ſince that the Guiſians vſurped this authoritie ouer the Crowne, by making our Kinges theyr ſlaues, we haue alwayes had two kinde of Councilles, of the Kinges Letters, and of his wordes, the one open, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſecrete. The priuie Councill doe entreate of ſuch matters as they woulde that all the worlde ſhould knowe. The letters patentes and open ſpeaches do ſerue for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmations of the ſame.</p>
            <p>But nowe the Guiſians haue induced a ſecret Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cill, which alſo ſometymes is deuided into three partes. For the Queene mother hath one, the Guiſians an other, and ſometyme the King hath the thirde, which doe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſte of certayne who doe gouerne him. In theſe Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils haue all the matters of our tyme bene determined of: from whence theſe bloody executions haue enſued. The letters of the Seale are ordinarily contrary to the letters patentes, and open ſpeaches vnto thoſe which are whiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered in the eare: as it came to paſſe at the comming of theſe Embaſſadoures, for publikely in the viewe of all the worlde, the King aunſwered them, that the Edicte of pacification was made for the expelling of the enemies out of his Realme, and for other matters generally: but particularly their demaundes were handled in the ſecret Councill, in ſuch wyſe as the effectes haue ſince declared. The ſixe and twentieth day of Februarie in the yere 1563. the King opened one parte of this declaration vnto the aforeſayd Embaſſadoures: and to the ende the better to colour all matters, the Cardinal and the Queene mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther had taught it him by hearte, togyther with the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner howe to pronounce it with his mouth, for at that time he was as well ſeene in that he ſpake, as in that that he ſpake not, for he was yet but a chylde, eſpecially in ſuch matters.</p>
            <p>Nowe muſt we note that one day before, the Cardinall had obteyned of the Queene a licence in the maner of a brief, ſigned by Secretarie Bourdin, wherein he was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
<pb facs="tcp:16276:80"/>
to beare weapons both by Edictes and letters pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentes forbidde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. But if any man aſke why he got this brief, rather of the Queene then of the King, ſeeing that the onely Lawmaker my diſpenſe with the law which him ſelfe hath made: eyther wherefore he demaunded not letters patentes rather then a ſimple briefe: I will leaue the iudgement therof to ſuch as be free from all affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. For that which immediatly enſued, doeth ſufficiently detect the purpoſes both of the Cardinall and his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herents.</p>
            <p>But to be able here to ſpecifie thoſe purpoſes, aſwell in the outridings which they procured the King to make, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der prete<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of the iourney to Bayonne, where their holy league was confirmed, &amp; order taken with the Duke of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ba for the ouerrunning of the Proteſtantes: eyther of cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne other leagues made in ſundrie partes of the realme through the driftes of the Guiſians, fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the which proce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the horrible murders, eſpecially in the Counties of Maine, Tourayne &amp; Vandoſme. Alſo in Guyen where the Marſhal of Bourdillo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; in other places other officers were to much at the becke of the Queene and the Guiſians. Neyther will I here particularly rehearſe theſe murders, whereafter folowed extorſions, and wonderfull iniuſtices in ſundrie cities of the realme: neyther the ſleights which the Cardinall vſed to winne the Prince of Conde, vnder pretence of an imaginatiue kingdome &amp; mariage, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to weaken the Admirall: Neyther will I ſpeake of the Citadels erected in ſundrie places in the Realme, of the razing of townes which the Proteſtantes held in the firſt troubles, of the falſe accuſations layde to their charges, of the declaration or Edict of Rouſſillon, which manifeſtly aboliſhed the Edict of pacification, of the ſcorning of the declarations which the Prince of Conde made againſt the ſame edict, togither with the flouting of thoſe who ſought for quietneſſe and iuſtice. Of the murders at Tours and at the caſtle of Loyre, of the preſumptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Chauigny, who was ſlaue to the Queene and the Guiſians, of the baniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

of certaine Proteſtantes in the towne of Rochelle. I will not here make any larger mention of the forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of the Proteſtants to keepe any ſcholes, which was done at the Cardinals purſuite, who therin did imitate the Edict of Iulian the Apoſtate againſt the Chriſtians: either of the ſaid Cardinals endeuour to deſtroy the ſoules togi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the bodies, in that he procured that the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters ſhould not viſite the ſicke, or abide in any other place then where the exerciſes of the Religion ſhould for the Bailiwickes be houlden.</p>
            <p>On the one ſide the Cardinal of Guiſe practiſed with the biſhop of Mans, whereof enſued infinite miſchiefes. On an other ſide the Duke of Aumale was in Champagne, where he did litle better. He tooke from them of Troye the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of their Religion, which by the Kings declaration was permitted in their ſuburbes, and aſſigned them an other very diſcommodious village. He by his owne auctority changed the place of the Bailiwick of Chaumont vnto Baſſigny, againſt the Kings expreſſe decree. And to the declaration which the Lieutenant of the Bailiwick (a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt enemy to the Goſpel) concerning the commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which he had to accommodate the Proteſtantes in caſe the gouernour ſhould refuſe: he anſwered that he had contrary Edicts from the King in his ſleeue, and therefore forbad the ſaid lieutenant from proceeding any further. He impriſoned an Aduocate at Troye, becauſe he had pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to the King a poore widowes ſupplication, whoſe ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes and legges they had after the peace cut of. He cauſed to pill and ſacke the receauer of Maſcons houſe. He in all maner of wiſe fauored the ſeditious and open murderers of Creuant. On an other ſide the Cardinal of Lorraine was in armes, accompanied with certaine knightes of the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and the rebels of Paris and other places, who ſeing the Proteſtantes on all ſides ouerrunne, ſought nothing but ſome mighty man to ſet them to the like worke, conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring alſo that the King was farre of, in whoſe abſence they were very deſirous to be doyng, and to make a terrible
<pb facs="tcp:16276:81"/>
broyle. But the Marſhal of Montmorency foreſeing the ſame, and vnderſtanding that not only at Paris, but alſo in moſt townes of the Realme; the ſeditious perſons lay in waite and watched for the Cardinals comming, certified the King of whatſoeuer he vnderſtood, whereupon he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued a precept, that he ſhould not permit the Cardinal or any of the Guiſians to enter in warlike araye into Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris. Again after that the Marſhall was aduertiſed of the brief, which the Cardinal had obteined of the Queene mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, he diuers times aduertiſed the King, eſpecially at Chaalons, Bar, Maſcon and Lions, that if the Cardinal and his garde came armed to Paris, he would indeuour to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arme him. Alſo fiue or ſixe moneths before the rumour was ſpred in Paris of the Cardinals comming garded with harquebuziers, the ſaid Marſhal made the like declaration both openly and particularly vnto the Cardinals eſpeciall ſeruantes. And to the ende no man might pretende any cauſe of ignorance, the thirtenth of December 1564, he made proclamation with ſound of trumpet, and then prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that vpon payne of death no ſouldiers ordeined for the garde of any gouernours or gouernement, ſhould en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter within his precinct: declaring in expreſſe wordes to the ende the Cardinal might vnderſtand that this defence touched himſelf, that it was not lawfull for any lorde what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer, vnleſſe he were a Prince of the houſe of France to enter into the gouernement of the yle of France with any garde. All this notwitſtanding, the Cardinal tooke his way to Paris: and departing from Reims, noyſed that he went vnto Ginuille. And although he were tender, yet did he in the ſharpeſt of winter take the fields, making exceeding iourneys, and ſuch as him ſelfe was neuer wonte to doe in any time whatſoeuer, or vpon any kinde of occaſion. After his comming to S. Dionice, there were many goings to and fro. In the meane time the Marſhal went to the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament houſe, where he knew the Cardinal had alwayes endeuored to procure moſt benefactours and friendes, there to complayne of the ſaid Cardinal, in that he came

to throwe himſelfe headlong, and as the prouerbe is, to burne in the flame.

            <p>The voyce went the ſame time, (and the Admiral whome the Marſhal of Montmorency had ſent for, to the ende to aſſiſte him both with counſayle and helpe, affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med the ſame to the chiefe of Paris) that there was a let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter which came from the Guiſians, ſent into Normandy, conteining theſe wordes. The readieſt way to reſtore in France thoſe to whom the Crowne doth appertayne by right, &amp; to expulſe the houſe of Valois, is to ſacke the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guenots who doe ſupport the ſame, and therefore we muſt ſel their woods to gather therewith money &amp; weapons: &amp; in the ende was added, that the ſaid Huguenots that would goe to law, neede not care for taxing their charges. It was not vnknowen alſo that in ſundry places the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickes
<pb facs="tcp:16276:82"/>
made collections of money, to what end let all men iudge. While the Admiral was at Paris, the Duke d'Aumale being hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>grye, &amp; ſeking to catch ſome odde Crowne, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew him ſelfe to Annet with his mother in lawe, whither he brought the garde which was allowed him for the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernement of Bourgundie, and there quaked for feare leſt the Marſhall of Montmorency, becauſe it was in his gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nement, and beſides for that his ſaid garde did many ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torſions vnto their neighbours, would ſend to apprehende him. Wherefore he writ euery way to his friendes, deſiring them to come and ſuccour him, and to helpe him to get away, ſo that he might goe to his charge. At this ſummons ſome came, others made no great accompt: &amp; of thoſe that came, there taryed not twenty, by reaſon of a certaine de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration, wherewith a gentleman of Normandy reduced them all to their right wits. For how would you (ſaid he to the Duke of Aumale) that we ſhould take weapon againſt a Marſhall of France, who with his only worde, is able to take the ſame from vs, and catch vs in his danger? Yea if he ſhould commaund vs to turne againſt you, what ſhould we doe, vnleſſe we would be rebels and diſobedient to our King? Againe, the aunſwer of a gentleman of Maine who could not come at his ſummons, which was intercepted, is worthy the noting, in reſpect of the French freedome of ſpeche vnto ſuch as know not them ſelues, wherein is to be ſeene what iudgement we are to giue of true Princes.</p>

ſaying that it was their cuſtome to giue out the fayreſt ſpeaches and promiſes in the worlde, he addeth this: In the meane time, brother, whiles you continue there, namely in Touraine, I think you were beſt to viſite the lorde of Montpenſier, to whom I wil write a letter bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring credite, according to your requeſt. And it were your wiſeſt; with him and other Lordes our friendes thereabout to practiſe ſome good aſſociatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, which ſhould haue bene long agoe compaſſed, if euery man had done his endeuour. I know ſome who were the motioners, and yet when it came to effect, they bledde at the noſe, as alſo in many other things: for if euery man would for his owne parte take paynes, we ſhould ſoone come to ſome good ende, conſidering what good occaſions are now of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered vs. But they whom it toucheth as neere as me, doe not accoumpt of it as I could wiſhe they did. I would be very loth the fault ſhould be in me: at the leaſt, if God lend me life, I wil let them vnderſtande the contrarie: and ſorye would I be, to loſe that reputation whereunto I haue ſo long aſpired, as I hope I ſhall not.

            <p>Now muſt I not forget to certifie you, that writing this letter, I had the ſight of the copye of another let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, which the lorde of Montpenſier wrote to the Marſhal of Montmorency, as an aunſwere to that which the ſaid Marſhal had written to him concerning his goodly deede.

notwithſtanding whatſoeuer the Prince of Condies and others declarations. When then the Catholicks remoued both heauen and earth, and brought al things into confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, a paper decree, ſtuffed ful of fayre pretences, quieted and appeaſed al, but if the Proteſtants ſtirred neuer ſo litle to the end vnder ſo violent a tyranny to take breath, then was no ſpeech but of fire and blood, as witneſſed the more then barbarouſe and turkiſh cruelties executed vpon the inhabitants of Pamiers, who falſly were accuſed of ſediti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, for that they would not ſuffer their throates to be cut, and yet at the firſt ſummons of the Lord of Ra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bouillet, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he came in the Kings name, and promiſed that they ſhould haue nothing done to them without order of lawe, they ſubmitted them ſelues.</p>
            <p>The King in the meane time arriued at Bayonne, where the holy league was renewed, which conteyned a full de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination to root out al the Proteſtantes, without excep<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of degree, kinde, age or place. They ſhould haue begun in France, but the preparatiues were ſomewhat long, for the Cardinal of Lorraine had not yet acco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pliſhed his pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſes in diuers places with ſtrau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gers: neither were the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſociations within the realme very wel aſſured.

            <p>About the ſame time began the warres of Flanders, by meanes wherof they determined, with the aduiſe of the Cardinal who daily was ſu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>moned to performe his promiſe as wel by the Cardinal Granuel as by the Pope, (for Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uel dayly aduertiſed him of al things) that without farther delay they ſhould vſe the Duke d' Albaes paſſage to bring their conſpiracies to effect: and diuers meſſages were ſent to the Duke d' Alba thereupon. About the ſame time alſo namely in the yere 1567 in the moneths of Iuly, Auguſt and September, ſundry councils were holden at Marchais and Monceaux, whereby to determine according to the
<pb facs="tcp:16276:86"/>
Cardinals remembrances, of the moſt aſſured and finall meanes, which were to be obſerued for the execution of their enterpriſes: and in the laſt council holden at Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chais through the Guiſians aduice, it was decreed that the King ſhould goe to Bois de Vincennes, and thither vnder ſome honeſt pretence ſhould ſend for the Prince of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and the Admiral: to the which commandement if they both, or any one of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> did obey, he ſhould immediatly be apprehended: but in caſe they refuſed, then the ſix thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Switzers who had bene leuied vnder pretence of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending Calais againſt the Queene of England, and alſo to keepe the borders vntil the Duke d' Alba were paſt, leſt he ſhould enterpriſe any thing againſt the Kings domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, ſhould be employed. Alſo that they had ready twenty two companies of men of warre, already choſen and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouled to muſter in armes, who were alreadye charged, through whoſe helpe togither with the ſaid Switzers, they might eaſely ſurpriſe and aſſure them ſelues of the Prince and Admiral. And in the meane time that with al rigour they ſhould reſearch the Proteſtants, touching their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauiours contrary to the edict of Rouſſillon, namely the gentlemen that had receiued into their houſes to the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, any other then their own ſubiectes. Whereupon at the inſtance and ſolliciting of the Cardinal of Lorrayn, it was decreed not long before his comming to the Courte, that the great dayes ſhould be holden at Poictiers, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally to tend vnto the proceſſe of thoſe who ſhould be fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d culpable in the ſaid pretended miſbehauiours, and them to declare guiltie of treaſon: and inaſmuch as thoſe preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentes and counſelours of the court of Parliament of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris, as were appointed to goe thither, ſeemed inſufficient, partial and factious in the Cardinals ſight, he cauſed to cut of ſeuen from the liſte which was firſt made, and in their ſteades did ſurrogate others of his owne creation and con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ditions. For the country of Normandy he ſent the maſter of requeſtes named S. Martin, to whom he procured a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

of Parliament of Rouen, tending that with the ſaid de. S. Martin, they ſhould tend to the performance of his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, and not breake vp the courte, notwithſtanding it were almoſt vacation time.</p>
            <p>On an other ſide the Cardinal endeuoured through the Conſtables meanes, to bring the Admiral and his brethre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> on ſleepe, who had already written certaine letters, which detected the traines layed for them. The ſixe thouſande Switzers who were leuied for the execution hereof, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout this time came to the King to Meaux, who was enui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roned with the Guiſians, ſo that the Prince and the Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral plainely perceiuing, that it was againſt them and the Proteſtants that theſe preparatiues were made, determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned before things were at a worſe poynct, to come to the King, and for that he was in both his and their enemies hands, they thought it beſt to take into their company cer<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>taine gentlemen of name, of their kinsfolkes and friends, to the number of a hundred or ſix ſcore, alſo to take ſome weapons for their aſſurance: which the Cardinal and his adherents failed not to cauſe the King to take in very euill parte, and the more to prouoke him againſt the Proteſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants, they perſwaded him that his death was at hand, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe with al ſpeed he got to Paris, ſeeing that the Prince of Condye and the Admiral came with fifteene hundred or two thouſand horſes, entending to force his maieſty, the Queene his mother and my Lordes his brethren, and to enterpriſe ſomewhat againſt the eſtate: and therefore the 28 of September about four of clocke in the morning, they cauſed the King to departe, and put him among the Swit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zers, ſuppoſing that if the Prince were ſo wel accompanied as they reported (which was falſe, for when he came to ſpeake to the King betwene Meaux and Paris, he had not at the moſt aboue thre hundred horſe) things might grow to ſuch paſſe, that ſtil ſome of their enemies of one ſide or other might go to wrack.

            <p>This day brought the Cardinal and his a great conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, in that they ſawe themſelues ridde of the Conſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and thereby the way open vnto the accompliſhment of their deſires. For on the one ſide, they endeuoured to make the King a ſworn enemie vnto the Proteſtants, who ſo much had ſtopped the courſe of the Guiſian preferre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and ſo through him to ouerthrow their aduerſaries. It was alſo requiſite to haue ſome other mightie man more at commandement then the King, vnder whoſe au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie they might ſhield themſelues in the execution of their paſſions. So ſone therfore as the Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſtable was dead, the Guiſians counſeled the Queene mother to make the Duke of Anjou the King his brothers lieutenant general: and ſhe perceiuing what commoditie thereby ſhe might reape, did ſoone follow this counſel. Whereupon the army marched, &amp; the Guiſians wholy gouerned the Duke of An<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>iou, &amp; vnder his ſhadow, both then &amp; euer ſince procured diuers fetches for the ouerthrow of the Proteſtants chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. But hereafter we wil ſhew what iniuries they haue done to the ſaid Duke, in vſing him as an inſtrument to ſubuert al France.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:16276:88"/>
in the yere 1568 he procured the King to ſend ſome men to the Prince to conclude a peace, that is to ſay, to vnarme the Proteſtants, whereby the more readily afterward to murder them. For he could not denie but that the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants were at that time the ſtrongeſt, and yet not being compelled through want, either of ſtrength or good ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe, did ſeparate and vnarme them ſelues, opening their townes to ſuch as the Queene and the Cardinal ſent in the Kings name, vnder whoſe onely faith and worde, they put away from them al aſſurance of liues and goods, yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding their naked breſtes vnto their aduerſaries ſwords and kniues. Al the Proteſtant Lords &amp; gentlemen departed to their owne houſes, whither when ſome could not find any ſure acceſſe, and others were ſo euil intreated, as that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers were moſt cruelly ſlaine &amp; murdered, manie of them were conſtrained to aſſemble themſelues together (which was it that the Cardinal and his fautors deſired, as wel to finde occaſion to ſlaunder them as infringers of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictes, as alſo to the end the more eaſily by ouerrunning of them to deſtroy them,) and not knowing what to do or whither to go, to take the way into Flanders verie vndiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretely, in that the King had forbidden them the ſame, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they were through meere neceſſitie, which (as the prouerbe is) hath no lawe, compelled thereunto. Howbeit the puniſhment was ſo readie and extreeme, that the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal and his partakers ought to haue bene content. They vſed in the execution thereof the Marſhal de Coſſe his aide, to the end to charge their rage vpon as wel one as other. Then ſent they a gentleman vnto the Prince of Conde, to know whether he allowed of the ſaid leuie of men, wherein is to be ſeene a right Cardinals fetch, for the maintaining of the King in his rage, expelling the Prince out of the Court, cauſing to ouerrunne him, or his troupes if he aduowed them, and ſo by litle and litle conſume his enemies. As for the ſtrangers come to the Proteſtants aide, they were preſently ſent home, and the Prince and other Proteſtants compelled to borowe great ſummes of
<pb facs="tcp:16276:88"/>
money wherewith to pay them: and yet through the Gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſians commandements, the garriſon of Auxerre ſtole part of that money, ſlaying ſome of the guydes and ranſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming others, without anie kinde of iuſtice, for the Lord of Prie gouernour of Auxerre, where this great murder was committed, had the Cardinals word.</p>

Wherin we wil recite part of the lamentation then publiſhed, referring to the readers remembrance certaine the particularities here o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, the number whereof is ſo great, that it is vnpoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for one man to thinke vpon them al. The ſtrength therefore and certaine aſſurance of this peace conſiſted in that, that the King, his brethren and their mother ſhould wholy blot out al kinde of miſtruſt conceiued againſt the Proteſtants, wherein they hoped that themſelues had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>readie taken a verie good order, through their ſo readie &amp; ſpedie obedience in forſaking their weapons, ſending a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way of ſuch of their power, as had bene ſufficient to haue ſubdued the Guiſians and other their enemies, and in yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding thoſe places wherein conſiſted their ſauegard. The Cardinal therefore to the end to preuent ſo great a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moditie, which vndoutedly had ſpoyled his attempts, ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded onely to the entertaining of the King and the Duke of Anjou (for as for the Queen mother, ſhe vſed her chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren after the Guiſians deſire) in theſe miſtruſts and mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal hatreds againſt the Proteſtants, daily repeating and putting them in minde of new occaſions. Wherein he holpe him ſelfe with two vertues, which alwaies he hath bene verie familiar withal, namely of boldneſſe to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uent al kinde of lies, being ſtil aſſiſted by men meete for his purpoſe in that reſpect: and of ſuch ſhameleſſe aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, that he would neuer be daſhed out of countenance, notwithſtanding his falſehoods were detected. His practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
<pb facs="tcp:16276:89"/>
which he hath exerciſed for both the entertainement and deſtruction of the nobilitie at once, his briberie and exactions againſt the Clergie, and the goodly pretences, vnder the which for that purpoſe he hath ſhrouded him ſelfe, ſhal be reueiled in place conuenient. In the meane time we wil beholde what iniuries he &amp; his haue ſtil done to the King, and generallly to the whole Realme, wherein we wil againe ſpeake of the true complaintes publiſhed thereagainſt.</p>
            <p>Soone after the peace, whereof the Cardinal ſent his mother word, that he would hinder the execution, he tooke order by certaine preachers of his owne faction, that the people might be perſuaded that it was a matter of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience to keepe this peace, not only for that it was made with heretikes and Atheiſts, but alſo becauſe through the neceſſitie of time it was in maner wreſted from the King by force. This cauſed that ſundrie Catholikes made no conſcience of putting of al natural affection, and that the moſt wicked finding the gate open vnto al theft and extor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, did without ſtoppe runne headlong into al kinde of miſchiefs, and the moſt horrible violences in the world. Whereunto the wincking of iudges and parliaments, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for the moſt part ſubiect vnto the Guiſians, did great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly auaile, inſomuch that within three or foure moneths af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, diuers perſons of al eſtates profeſſing the Religion were murdered, the particularities whereof we wil referre vnto the hiſtorie of our time. But in this place are two no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table particularities. Preſently after the peace, the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likes of Amiens among other, murdered ſix or ſeuen ſcore Proteſtants of al kindes, ages and conditions. Now to the end to make men beleeue, that they ſought to chaſtiſe and puniſh ſo wicked and curſed a deede, they ſent thither the Marſhal de Coſſe, who impriſoned the authours of this murder: but ſoone after at the ſolliciting of the Cardinal, they were releaſed &amp; ſet at libertie, for he in ful counſayle affirmed that they ought to take pitie of theſe poore pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners, who through a godly zeale of Religion had bene
<pb facs="tcp:16276:89"/>
moued to do this deede, and that him ſelfe would be the firſt that ſhould ſue for their pardon, and ſo for a forme of iuſtice they cauſed to whippe three or foure raſcals, whom they perſuaded to confeſſe what they were, and in picture executed ſuch as indeede ought to haue bene puniſhed in perſon, who alſo were preſent at the execution of their owne pictures.</p>
            <p>Toward the end of Iune in the ſame yere 1568, was Rene of Sauoy Lord of Sipierre murdered in Prouence, togither with fiue and thirtie gentlemen and ſouldiers of his traine, according to a certaine precept which the Gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſians ſent vnto the Baron des Arts: and fiftene daies be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the ſaid murder, the Cardinal of Guiſe in much com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panie ſaid that they might alreadie accompt the Lord of Sipierre for a ſlaine Captaine, and that ſo they ſhoulde ſhortly haue al the reſt.</p>
            <p>By theſe and infinite ſuch other deedes, the Proteſtants in ſtead of being taken into their houſes with the freedom of conſcience according to the Edict, were now forced to flie, the townes being in ſtead of townes, become dennes of Tygres and Lions. And afterwarde the gouernours, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments &amp; other officers, whome the Cardinal vſed at his pleaſure, and who alſo for the moſt part were not verie deſirous to publiſh the peace, leaſt thereby they ſhoulde loſe the meanes to ſpoyle after their vſual maner, had their excuſe readie: namely that the people being thus moued alreadie, it was not beſt to proceede anie far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for feare of marring all. In the meane while, the King him ſelfe was not onely entertayned through a thouſand falſe and impudent ſlaunders in the miſtruſt alreadie conceiued of his ſubiectes, which is the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt miſchiefe that may alight vpon anie Prince: but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo contrarie vnto al royal generoſitie, was put in feare and reduced to this point, that he was fully perſuaded that it was vnpoſſible that he ſhoulde be thorowly obeyed, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe the one part of his ſubiectes might be permitted to deſtroye the other, and therefore it was an eaſie matter
<pb facs="tcp:16276:90"/>
for the Cardinal to wreſt the edict of peace into an occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of a thouſand millions of troubles.</p>
            <p>Moreouer, the Cardinal foreſeeing that if all the prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants ſhould at once be turned out at doores, they might aſſemble and fortifie themſelues againe in ſundrie places, therefore prouided againſt that miſchiefe as followeth, yea, he preſumed to write into the prouinces, that they ſhould not credit the Kings letters, vnleſſe they had ſome other aſſured tokens. Firſt he procured the edict by litle and litle to be publiſhed, ſometime here and ſometime there, to the end to drawe the moſt needy and ſimple per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons into the townes: but with this watchword, that the gates ſhould be kept with armes eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> more diligently then during the warres, that they ſhould vtterly vnarme the Proteſtants at their entrye, that they ſhould not permit any that once were entred, to get forth againe notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandinge they abiured. And in al this the Cardinal was ſo wel obeyed, that few townes eſcaped without ſome ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt and open murder, beſides al other violences which were exerciſed, to the end to make the moſt conſtant to reuolt: which could not but come to paſſe when the ſword was once taken from the King and iuſtice, and committed to the hands of the communaltie with al immunitie. Alſo to the end to be aſſured that neuer a proteſtant might eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape, the Cardinal gaue the King to vnderſtand that he ſhould neuer remaine ſafe from the Huguenots practiſes, vnleſſe the townes which they had holden, together with ſuch as were their captaines neighbours were furniſhed with good and ſtrong garriſons: ſo that this was no ſooner counſelled, but it was alſo commanded. Alſo yet for their more aſſured deli<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gs herin, if there were any captain renow<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>med for theuery, or cruelty, either any who had euer a pri<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uate quarel, or any company giuen ouer to al leudeneſſe, thoſe were ſure to be preferred, how many ſoeuer there were of them, to the ende to repleniſh the townes ſo ſone as they were yelded, or to lye about the houſes of the Prince of Condie, the Admirall and other Lordes, whome
<pb facs="tcp:16276:90"/>
the Cardinal hated, and ſtood in moſt feare of. Alſo when one of the priuie Councill chaunced to ſhewe the ſayde Cardinall that it was to be feared, leaſt hereby the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantes ſhould ouer ſoone perceiue and ſmell that they would not obſerue the edict, alſo leaſt the Catholikes ſhould complaine of being ouerpreſſed, the charges being ſo great that the King were not able to beare them: he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, ſaying, You knowe not what you ſay. For the firſt of theſe two pointes, the anſwere is ready, namely that it is for the mainteining of both parties in peace according to the edict: and as for the ſecond, for the Souldiers lod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging among the Huguenots, and ſo an hundred fould o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uercharging of them, as touching Cottiſings, all ſuch mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters ſhal light vpon their coffers: &amp; howſoeuer it be, their confiſcations ſhall paye for all, and ouer and beſides ſuch recompences, ſhall diſcharge the Kings debts.</p>
            <p>The Cardinal not yet content, to the end to keepe the ſaid lords of the Religion from comming to the court, and more ſurely to prouide for the execution of his drifts, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded the King that his perſon ſhould neuer be in ſafetie, without keeping him ſelfe as it were ſhut vp in Paris for a time, and not to ſtray away thence but by litle and litle. This when he had obtained, for the better keeping of his priſoner, he made drawbridges, and other gardes in al the waies and entries into Paris, as in time of open warre.</p>
            <p>Hauing thus framed his nets, he made an Edict in the Kings name, wherewith to drawe all the Proteſtants into the townes, there to murder them or keepe them priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners in their owne houſes, at the mercie of a number of thieues, vntil the appointed houre for the Sicilian euen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſong.

letters or purſes which thirtene ribbauldes were not ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to viſite from one place to another, thereof to make reporte vnto the ſaid Cardinal, we muſt marke what order he tooke, vnder colour ſaid he to keepe the Proteſtantes from aſſembling togither to conſpire againſt the Kinge. As indeede that was one marke that he ſhot at, together with certaine other more high attempts, in caſe his enter<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>priſes againſt the Prince of Condye and the Admirall had had good ſucceſſe. Howbeit the commiſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which then he procured, more manifeſtly did reueile the iniurie which he did to the King and the realme: alſo his vehement de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to trouble al the eſtate, to the ende to exalt his owne race through his enemies ouerthrowe. This therefore was the tenour of the commiſſion, made about the time of the edict afore ſet downe: namely in the moneth of Maye 1568. The King hath ordeined captaine N. in the towne of N. there to remaine Captaine and keeper of the bridge and paſſage: to whome ſhal be deliuered twelue men to aſſiſt his perſon, whome he may command whatſoeuer he thinketh meet &amp; conuenient for the Kings ſeruice. which twelue men his maieſtie ſhal pay, ouer and beſides the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment alowed to the ſaid captaine. He ſhal firſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure to make a drawbridge ouer the ſayde paſſage, which he and his twelue men ſhall daye and night diligentlye and warily watche and keepe: not permitting any to paſſe vnleſſe he firſt knowe whence he commeth, whither he goeth, what his buſineſſe is and who himſelfe is. Alſo ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any numbers of men approching to the paſſage ouer the ſayd bridge, he ſhall preſently cauſe it to be drawne, not ſuffering the paſſage to be taken before he be aſſured of the ſame, &amp; do know that they haue no meanes to hurt him. Alſo to the ende that he &amp; his twelue men with him may continually remaine at the ſaid bridge, with al conue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient commodities, he ſhal immediatly take order for the making of a lodge neere vnto the ſaid bridge, whither he and his ſouldiers may retire, lodge and accommodate the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſelues, in not going from the ſaide bridge or abandoning
<pb facs="tcp:16276:92"/>
the cuſtodie thereof: and to the ſame effect his maieſtie hath written to the inhabitants of the ſame towne, that they at their owne coſt do make the ſaid lodge and draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge. Alſo foraſmuche as it may greatly aduantage the ſaid captaine towarde his ſure keeping of the ſaid bridge, and prouiding that there be no meanes to ſurpriſe the ſame, to haue knowledge of things done in the ſaid quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, he ſhal endeuour to diſcouer to his power the acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and intentes of thoſe of the new religion: and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of any thinge preiudicial to the Kings maieſties ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice, he ſhal looke diligently to his charge, and giue war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning vnto the Captaine of the next bridge, paſſage or towne: and the like ſhal all other captaines do, who haue commiſſion for the keeping of any other bridges or paſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, til time the King be thereof aduertiſed, ſo that he may take ſome order. And although the principal cauſe which moued the King to commit this captaine to the charge of the bridge or paſſage aforeſaid, is for the ſafe cuſtodie thereof, yet ſhal he for his part take diligent heede, that the Proteſtants haue no preachings or other exerciſes of their religion, in any other place then his maieſtie hath to them ordeined and eſtabliſhed as wel by the contents of his edictes of pacification, as alſo by the rule preſcribed ſince the publication of the laſt edict. He ſhal hearken and take good hede (as much as poſſibly he may) that the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtantes make no enroulings of men of warre, no leuyes or collections of coyne, no vnlawful aſſemblies, or no mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of warre, either where his charge lyeth, or in any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther place thereabout: but ſhal prouide for faithful men to aduertiſe him, and if neede be to ſend ſome of the skilful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſt about him, and ſuch as haue any vnderſtanding, or do ſeme meet to penetrate into the ſaid Proteſtants affaires, to the end they may certifie him of whatſoeuer they can learne out.

Then was the warre open: and whyle they prepared to cauſe the Catholicke army to march vnder the conduct of the Duke of Anjou, the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal deuiſed two Edictes publiſhed both in one day in the Parliament of Paris, namely the 28. of September, to wit, the third day after that they had bene framed in the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cill. In the firſt, the King making a long diſcourſe of things happened in his Realme through the Religion, declareth among other things, that the Edict of Ianuary, wherein he granted the Proteſtantes leaue to exerciſe their Religion, was but prouiſionall attending his maiority: alſo that now he was no lenger minded to permit the edictes touching Religion to ſtand any longer in force. Alſo that now being come to his maioritye, he forbiddeth all excerciſe of the ſame within his dominions, willing perpetually that there be no other exerciſe of Religion, ſauing the Romaine in all his iuriſdictions, vnder payne of confiſcation of body and
<pb facs="tcp:16276:95"/>
goods. Alſo vnder like penalty, he chargeth al miniſters of the ſaid Religion, to auoyde his Realme within fifteene dayes: forbidding neuertheles that any of the ſaid Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on be reſearched in their conſciences, ſo long as peaceably they wil liue in their houſes. In the other he declared that from that time forward he did not intende to vſe the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice of any of the ſaid Religion, and thereby did ſuſpend them from their offices and functions: commanding them to come, and giue vp the ſame into his handes within fifteene dayes, or elſe him ſelfe woulde otherwiſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uide. Theſe two Edictes had long bene vpon the file, and the Cardinall a farre of ſhewed the ſame to the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickes, to moue them to come to the offring, and to bring in coyne for the armyes paye, wherein he, the Queene mother, and their mynions vſed their wonted ſportes. But theſe Edictes were more preiudicial to the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickes then they ſuppoſed, for moſt of the Proteſtantes, who otherwiſe were not determined to haue gone out at the doores, behoulding this ſo manifeſt periurye, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with the Cardinal diffamed the houſe of Valois, tooke the fieldes preſently. Alſo the Proteſtante Lordes ſent theſe Edictes into England and Germany, as aſſured te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimonies that they were not purſued, as ſeditious per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons or aſpirers vnto the crowne (as before it had bene noyſed) but as defenders of the Goſpel, which the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickes endeuored to roote out of France. This was all that the Cardinall or his adherents gate thereby. About this time, were many writings publiſhed againſt the preſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptuous and ambitious cruelty of the Guiſians, but chiefly againſt the Cardinall, whoſe nature was amply deſcribed by a certaine learned French Poete, in a certaine Sonnet comprehending a curſe in the ende.</p>

            <p>This third ciuil warre beginning in October 1568, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinewed to the beginning of Auguſt 1570, the hiſtorye whereof hath bene at large written and publiſhed, wherin is to be ſeene how the Catholickes and Proteſtantes haue one deſtroyed the other, by viewing what battailles haue bene fought, what places beſieged and taken, or what cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines and ſouldiers haue bene ſlayne: ſo that the French<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men haue committed againſt them ſelues, that which peraduenture all other nations in Europe together could not haue accompliſhed. Whiles in the meane time the Cardinal behelde this bloody tragedie, and practiſed all meanes to make the one parte to deſtroy the other. And for that it would be an infinite labour to deſcribe all his driftes, it ſhall now ſuffice to conſider parte of his ſubtilties vſed during this third ciuill warre.</p>
            <p>Firſt he aſſured him ſelfe of the Kings perſon, whom he ledde hither and thither according as things fell out, and ſo prouided that nothing might be done without his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice. He ſerued alſo in ſtead of a firebrand to kindle the King more &amp; more againſt the Proteſtants, chiefly againſt the chief of them, in whoſe reſpect he practiſed all kinde of violences and treaſons for the compaſſing of his purpoſes.
<pb facs="tcp:16276:96"/>
Some being taken priſoners were (notwithſtanding all vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed faith) ſlaine, others were poiſoned, againſt others were murderers hiered, vnto whom the Cardinal gaue great rewardes.</p>
            <p>Then gatte he many ſeruantes about the Duke of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jou the Kings lieutenant generall, by whom he might in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſe the ſaid Duke againſt the Proteſtants. This was of ſo dangerous conſequence vnto the Prince of Conde, that finally it coſt him his life. For Monteſquiou, the ſaid Dukes Captaine of his garde, ſlew the Prince, whom the lordes of Argence, and of S. Iohn had taken priſoner. Vnder the ſame policie the ſaid Duke would grant no ſafe conduite vnto the lorde de l'Eſtrange, the deputie in the behalfe of the Proteſtant Lordes &amp; Princes in Iune 1569, who ſhould haue gone to preſent their ſupplication to the King, as tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching ſuch meanes and remedies, as he knew moſt conue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient and profitable for appeaſing of the warre, and eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhing of a perfect peace.</p>
            <p>The ſame policye did the Cardinall vſe in hindering the concluding of the peace: For being certified that the Admirall had ſent the ſaid ſupplication to his couſin the Marſhal of Montmorency, that he might offer the ſame to the King, he preuented the ſaid Marſhal, alleaging vnto the King, that it was no reaſon that ſuch rebellious ſubiects ſhould ſpeake to the King afarre of, alſo that vnleſſe they came and yelded them ſelues to his mercie, they were not to be heard, but with weapons to be ſubdued. According to which counſayle the King ſhewed the ſaid Marſhall of Montmore<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cy, that he would neither looke vpon, or heare any thing that came from the Proteſtants, but chiefly from the Admiral, before he had taken them to fauour, which he would doe in caſe they would yelde to doe their due<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties: as if afore the ſaid Admiral and his men had not moſt earneſtly entreated the King, like as now againe in this ſupplication they did, for theſe wordes were therein con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teined: They doe moſt humbly deſire your Maieſtye to graunt, and generally permit to all your ſubiectes of what
<pb facs="tcp:16276:96"/>
eſtate or condition ſo euer they be, free exerciſe of their religion in al townes, villages and boroughes, and in al o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther partes &amp; places of your realme and countries in your obedience and protection, without exception, moderatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> or reſtraint of perſons, time or place, with all requiſite and neceſſarie aſſurance. And moreouer to ordeyne &amp; inioine al men, openly to profeſſe eyther the one or the other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, thereby to cut of diuers, who abuſing this benefite and fauour, are fallen into Atheiſme and all carnall liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, hauing freed them ſelues fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the exerciſe and profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of al religions, being deſirous to ſee nothing but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion in this realme, togither with the ouerthrowe and ſuppreſſion of all order, policie, and eccleſiaſticall diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline, which is a moſt pernicious and daungerous matter, vtterly intolerable. Alſo, deare Lorde, for as much as the ſayde Princes, Lordes, Knights, Gentlemen and other in their companies, doubt not but they, who hitherto haue planted the foundations of their practiſes vpon ſuch ſlaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders as impudently they doe publiſhe, to the ende to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure the ſayd Princes to be brought into the hatred and diſpleaſure, euen of ſuch as through the grace of God, are freed from all bondage and tyrannie of Antichriſt, wil not fayle but affirme that they will rather ſtifly without reaſon defend whatſoeuer they once haue determined to beleue, touching the Articles of Chriſtian religion, then correct and withdrawe them ſelues, therefore the aforeſaid Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, Lordes, Knights, Gentlemen and other their compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie doe declare and proteſt, as alwayes they haue done, that if in any one point of the confeſſion of fayth hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore preſented to your Maieſtie by the reformed churches of your realme, they may be inſtructed, that by Gods word comprehended in the Canonical bookes of the holy ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, they haue ſtrayed from the doctrine of the Apoſtles or Prophetes, they will readily yeeld and willingly graunt to ſuch as by Gods word may better inſtruct them, then in the beginning they haue bene, if they doe erre in any ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle. And for this cauſe doe deſire nothing ſo much as a
<pb facs="tcp:16276:97"/>
conuocation of a free, general and lawful councill, wherin euery man may be heard alleadge their reaſons, which muſt be either confirmed, or conuinced by the onely word of God, according to the maner vſed in all times for like occaſions.</p>
            <p>In the meane time the Cardinall brought vp the Duke of Aniou at the charges of the Clergie and Catholikes, to the end to deſtroy the Proteſtants, and to get a new ſtring vnto his bow, wherwith he might ſhoote at other matters, in caſe the warre had ſuch ſucceſſe as he wiſhed. For as for peace he accompted it vnpoſſible and paſt hope of beyng concluded, without the vtter deſtruction and aboliſhing of the contrary faction. Now ſought he continually to cloke his priuate intereſt, and to cauſe the King to thinke it vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to come to any peace, and ſo conſequently to ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard all things rather then to yeelde ſo much, and to that end propounded two great lets. The firſt taken of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trariety of religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, which (ſaid he) neither could nor ought to be borne withall in the realme. The other deriued from the Kings maieſties fame, which (ſayd he) the proteſtantes had blemiſhed, and therfore it was vnpoſſible for them to ſalue vp ſuch a wound, vnleſſe laying down their weapons, they came in haulters about their neckes to ſubmit them ſelues to the Kings mercie, ſitting in his ſeat of the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals iuſtice. But he alleaged theſe reaſons (to the which the proteſtants haue often ſufficiently anſwered) not ſo much for any zeale to religion, whereof in the bookes folowing we will more amply entreat, neither for any affectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to the King againſt whom he conſpired, but rather becauſe that before he grau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted to any motion of peace, he would be aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured that howſoeuer matters went, he &amp; his would keepe the chief roome in the counſail of the King &amp; realme, that he might put out or in, the officers of the crown at his own diſcretion, that he might ordeine and diſpoſe the lawe &amp; treaſurie, as ſeemed beſt to his couetous appetite: to be brief, that the realme might of him take lawes to do or not to do, to ſpeake or not to ſpeake, &amp; at one word, that at his
<pb facs="tcp:16276:97"/>
pleaſure he might remoue both ſoules, bodyes and goods, both of the heade and members of the ſaid Realme.</p>
            <p>He feared alſo leaſt the King ſhould giue eare vnto the declarations of the Proteſtantes deputies, wherby in time he might eaſely perceiue, that thoſe counſeilers who haue giuen him to vnderſtand, that the onely meanes to extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhe in his realme all diuerſitie of Religion, was through warre, were Atheiſtes, or els braineleſſe perſons wholy ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant euen to the ende. Alſo leaſt the King might call to minde how that ſince the ſaid Cardinals returne from the Councill of Trent, the whole body of his priuie councill hath bene deuided and parted into two ſeuerall opinions, the one part wiſhing for peace, the other for warre: and therefore the Cardinall and his adherentes might be the worſe entreated. Wherefore he reſolued togither with his partakers, ſo much as might be to prolong the warre, ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to corrupt and frame the King after his owne appetite, and ſo deſtroye the Proteſtantes, thereby to prepare the readier path to the performance of his ſecret driftes. He perſwaded him ſelfe in time to conquere the ſaide Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantes. Firſt, being driuen out of moſt townes in the Realme, and reduced into the extremities of the ſame in a litle corner of Saintonge, they might eaſely be incloſed in this ſmall quantitie of ground, by meanes of ſuch riuers &amp; townes as doe abbut vpon the Marches of Angoulmois &amp; the places thereabout: ſo that being once raunged within ſuch barres, the famine and infection of the ayre, rayſed through the vapoures of their troupes and companies, ſhould within fewe moneths force them to come in with haulters about their neckes, and ſo to yeelde them ſelues to his diſcretion &amp; mercy. Then that the principal ſtrength of the Princes campe conſiſting in ſtraungers, for the payment of whoſe arrearages alreadie due vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, vntill then the proteſtants had almoſt drawe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> their purſes drie, &amp; therfore had ſmall opportunitie in tyme to come to ſatisfie the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: they of frie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds ſhould become foes, which eaſely might
<pb facs="tcp:16276:98"/>
be compaſſed, and they be entiſed if not to fight with the Proteſtantes, yet at the leaſt vpon payment of their due<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties to returne home into theyr owne countries. Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally, the Cardinal grounded the prolo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ging of the warre vpon the vncertayne hazard of battayles, by reaſon of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conueniences of his owne parte. All ſuch as co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſidered that now all the French Nobilitie, and the chief part of their warriours were already in the fields vpon the point, in caſe any battayle ſhould be fought, to murder one an other, did bewayle the miſerable eſtate of the King and his Realme, who leaned to their ſubuerſion through the happe of ſuch a meeting, to whom ſoeuer the victorie fel. But the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall and his factio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> made ſo ſmal accompt hereof, that they could haue wiſhed that the parte lying vpon the ground, had left the conquerours ſo wounded, that they might ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer haue riſen again: not in hope to haue created any new French nobilitie with a ſheet of paper, or a skinne of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chement, and foure vnces of waxe (according to the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nals apophthegme, which was that the King was able in one houre to create more Gentleme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, then in tenne yeres ſpace might be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſumed in the warres) but rather for that that the ſayd French nobilitie being extinguiſhed, the way would be the readier vnto the accompliſhme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of the Gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſians forecaſtes, and through the ſupporte of the Mayres, Sheriffes, and Counſaylours of the moſt part of the townes in France, of long time affectionate vnto the Cardinal, like as were the courtes of Parliame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, vnder pretence of main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayning the Catholike Church, they might chalenge the title to the Crowne, the which they haue ſo long boaſted to appertaine vnto the houſe of Lorraine, by vertue of an imaginatiue ſucceſſion from the ſtocke of Charles the great: Howbeit the Cardinall fearing leaſt the battayle ſhould be tryed rather in the maner of a fraie, and diſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of one of the armies, then by any great bloodſhead, thought beſt to aſſure him ſelfe through delayes in prolo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging the time, rather then to buylde his full hope vpon ſo wauering and daungerous a foundation. For if the victorie
<pb facs="tcp:16276:98"/>
had fallen to the Proteſtants, the Guiſians would haue ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compted them ſelues vndone: alſo if the Cardinals armie had gotten the beſt, then did he forecaſt that their furie being ouer, ſome of the Catholikes might haue commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced as dangerous a quarel againſt him as that, and agayne require of him the liues of ſuch Lords and Gentlemen, as peraduenture had bene offred vpon the altar of his ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. For all they that ſerued the Duke of Anjou, were not ſo bent vnto the Guiſians ſeruice, as the ſaid Cardinal and his adherents could haue wiſhed.</p>
            <p>Thus did the Cardinal ſpin this corde of Ciuil warres, &amp; draw it as long as he could, notwithſtanding that in his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations there paſſed great ouerſights, which here I will neyther detect, neyther confute, for that is the office of ſome ſuch perſon as hath leyſure to deuiſe ſome politike diſcourſes, and reueale the blindneſſe of the French Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike Gentlemen, who in profeſſing them ſelues men of experience and practiſe, haue ſuffered a prieſt to baffulle them, who was more cowardly then a woman, and who al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo in his ſleeue in the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>panie of his familiar friends with open throate ſcorned them, as in place conuenient we ſhal hereafter ſee.</p>
            <p>The Duke d'Aumale was vpon the borders of Bour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gundy &amp; Lorraine, accompanied with great troupes ouer whom he commaunded, and there wayted to ſtoppe the paſſage of the Reiſtres, who came to the proteſtants ayde. Wherein he had as good ſucceſſe as in other his martiall deedes: For his ſouldiers openly ſayde that he had more fleſhe then witte or courage. And in deed notwithſtanding he were in a conuenient cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>try for his footmen, of whom there were a great number, and thoſe trayned ſoldiers, yet did he nothing worth the ſpeaking of, but ſundrie tymes was in dau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ger of being wel beaten, yea he refuſed to meet with his enemies in a place greatly to his aduauntage. But to ſay the trueth, the Cardinall was alſo one cauſe of theſe kinde of dealings, for he minded not that they ſhoulde ſo ſoone come to handy blowes, but hoped eyther to winne
<pb facs="tcp:16276:99"/>
the ſtraungers, or els to finde them at a better aduantage, and ſo ſought more and more to ſhuffle the cardes, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he might meete with the better game.</p>
            <p>As for the yong Duke of Guiſe, through his great fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour with the Duke of Anjou, proceeding of their ſtraight acquaintance, beſides that he was great maſter, he was now highly aduanced. His vncle alſo placed about him many captaynes, who at Poictiers ſtood him in good ſtead. The Marquiſe of Maine his yonger brother, was then through his youth of no countenance. The great Prior and the Marquiſe d'Ellebeufe his vncles were dead a while before, neither were they greatly regarded, as men hauing no more witte then their brother the Cardinal of Lorraine had beſtowed vpon them, neither were they fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctious, but as he taught and commaunded them.</p>
            <p>But at all aduentures, we haue extended this matter farre enough in this firſt parte of the legende of the lordes of Guiſe: We will therefore permit the readers to take breath, and giue our penne ſome reſpite, whereby to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceede in the reſte, namely of the behauiours of the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall and his adherents in the third Edict of pacification, alſo of their meanes to atteine vnto the murder at S. Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemewes daye: alſo of ſuch things as of their partes haue ſince chanced to the confuſion of King Charles and his eſtate. Alſo of the euill pranckes which they haue played with King Henrye the third now reigning, with all the princes of the blood, the great Lordes, the Nobilitye, the Iuſtices, the Clergie, the people as well of the one as of the other Religion, their fautours and friendes, yea and one of them ſelues with an other. Here before we haue ſeene parte of their dealinges vnder Francis the firſt, Henry the ſecond, Francis the ſecond, and Charles the ninthe: but the ſundry particularityes, which ſhalbe ſet downe in the other bookes following, will ſhew that in this firſt parte we haue only touched the matters, and deſcribed as it were the entrye into the bloody, villainous and accurſed palace of the Guiſians. Let this therefore be the beginning of a
<pb facs="tcp:16276:99"/>
greater worke, &amp; I would to God that by this that is paſt, the Frenchmen might (though ſomewhat late and to their coſt) know part of thoſe inſtruments wherwith the Lord for their offences hath ſcourged them, to the end that returning vnto him as they ought, they might receiue ſoner then I hope for, ſome reſt and eaſe.</p>
